-  Larry Padey inspired by John Guzzwell
"  Larry’s dream caught fire as he read about local hero John Guzzwell, who’d built the 20-foot sloop Trekka in his mother’s garage and set off with $500 in his pocket. In his book, Trekka Around the World, John chronicled amazing adventures as he circumnavigated the globe, returning four years later with $350.

-  Only save 1 year of cruising kitty
"  Perhaps it’s because people who can cope with offshore cruising can also adapt to jobs that are available as they cruise. Or perhaps because they are cruising people they are more interesting to potential employers. Whatever the case, once you decide to go, get your boat and a year’s funds and go! You’ll find it’s relatively simple to continue and not too hard to earn your way. If you decide to give up cruising, you may not be able to step right back into the same job situation, but, armed with new experiences and contacts, you might find one that’s even better.

-  Temporary mooring using anchor chain
"  Although we never learned why, all the boats chose to swing to only one anchor, and since they did, we had to as well. A longtime resident taught us this trick: Anchor as you would in any two-fathom anchorage, paying out 50 feet of chain as you drift downcurrent, then quickly drop 100 feet of chain in a pile. As the tide changes, your boat swings around the pile of chain and never gets near enough to the anchor to foul it. It’s an unusual trick, and it works.

-  Leaving boat on anchor for several weeks
"  We’d be away for several weeks, and we wanted to be certain our boat would be secure. To begin with, we set our 22-pound Danforth anchor and lowered half of our 300 feet of chain. At the midpoint, we shackled on a swivel to which we led a long line. Then we drifted down-wind, paying out the rest of the chain until we reached the bitter end. Here we attached our 33-pound kedge and dropped it overboard with a long trip line. Then we hauled the boat back to the swivel, attached two 5/8-inch nylon lines to it with shackles, and secured each shackle with a wire seizing. We lowered the swivel into the water until it was below our keel and cleated the two 5/8-inch lines on deck with good chafing gear on them.

-  Overnight change of weather
"  Since we were content with the safety of the anchorage at Coronado, and since our barometer read 29.5 (winds from the south), we put our cushions in the cockpit to sleep in the open. (Larry had built our cockpit so that the cushions from our quarter berths exactly fit it, and it converts easily to a 4’0’x6’2’ honeymoon bunk.) Just after midnight, we both awoke when an unusually cool breeze whispered through. By the time we had tossed our bedding below, 60 knots of wind slashing down off the island hit us, breaking the battens in our awning and laying the boat over, with the rail awash. In an instant, we had lightning, thunder, and driving rain. Seraffyn lay beam-to the wind, so we struggled to get the furled jib off the bowsprit—to reduce windage. Larry crawled forward and I dashed below to open the forehatch. As Larry unclipped each hank, I slowly dragged the drenched and whipping sail below decks. The waves threw spray that fell like buckshot. With the sail below, Larry put out 150 feet of extra chain.

-  Anchors as life insurance
"  Good ground tackle is the best yacht and life insurance there is. With a good nonfouling anchor, well weighted with nonchafing, strong chain, you get a peaceful night’s sleep or a worry-free day ashore. Dragging is almost always a case of poor choice of anchor for the type of bottom, insufficient weight to hold the anchor down in a position to do its job, or too little scope. And our husky anchor windlass means that either of us can haul up the anchor under almost any weather conditions.

-  Interior boat cleaning every year
"  Then, with a hose and a bucket of soapy water, we scrubbed Seraffyn from chain locker to sternpost, flushing down the soap and dirt as we went along and pumping the bilges as she filled. We inspected every inch of the boat as we dried it with a chamois. Then we returned everything to its place, checking each item before putting it back on board. We chucked out such items as paint cans with only half an inch of old paint; our rubbish heap was staggering. We polished our oil lamps and trimmed the wicks. Larry inspected the rigging from mast truck to deck. Then, after three days of varnishing the exterior bright-work, we had a new boat. Seraffyn’s absolute simplicity and small size, with no vulnerable mechanical toys and no sensitive electronic gear or wiring, have allowed us to repeat this operation once or twice a year, resulting in a sweet freshness below, sparkling bilges, reliable sailing gear, and a proper waterline level as our reward. Few cruising people—even experienced ones—realize how much salt is carried below decks by sodden foulweather gear, wet feet, and bathing suits, or how it accumulates, causing the constant dampness that leads to mildew. By eliminating the salt, canned foods with no protection can remain in our food lockers, right up against the planking, for as much as a year without any serious rusting.

-  Close call with a ship at night
"  LARRY WOKE ME suddenly on our second night at sea with a startled shout: “Look how close that ship is!” We had gone to sleep feeling secure, certain we were outside the shipping lanes. Larry had awakened—as usual—every two or three hours to take a look around. I was shaken as I stared at the huge cruise liner that loomed over us and seemed within touching distance as it crossed our bow. Could it have seen our little cutter? Our navigation lights seemed large to us, but from aboard that glowing ship, they probably were almost invisible. The ship was actually about mile off as it passed us, and we were in no real danger, but it felt like a close call. Afterward, we discussed the incident and agreed that henceforth neither of us would rest well unless the other was on watch, in or out of the shipping lanes. We decided to adopt a new routine of standing watches at all times—three hours on three hours off. With Helmer steering, standing watch meant reading a book, writing letters, puttering in the galley, or stargazing—there was no “work” except a careful look around every 10 minutes. We’ve continued this practice ever since, and it makes for greater safety and a sounder sleep for the person off watch.

-  Why no engine?
"  In the clear water, our deep keel and rudder were clearly visible. “Do you have a motor?” one of them asked. “No, only sails,” Larry replied.
"  “Pobrecitos [poor little ones],” they exclaimed, pointing to their brand-new Volvo-Penta diesels.
"  “Why don’t you have an engine?” is a question we are often asked, and these men were no exception.
"  Our standard response, “We can’t afford one,” was immediately understandable to two Mexican turtle fishermen, but many yachtsmen think that cruising without a motor is both frightening and dangerous. Perhaps the reasons behind our decision are worth explaining.
"  To install a small diesel engine properly with tanks, hull fittings, shaft, prop, and controls would cost us at least $2,500—the same amount as all our living and cruising expenses during the 12 months we were in Mexico! A year’s freedom for the price of an engine. Also, the space under the cockpit usually occupied by an engine is where we carry seven bags of sails, freeing the forepeak for our cozy double berth and, quite literally, doubling the storage space and water-carrying capacity of our 24-footer. Without an engine, we are forced to be doubly careful with navigation and planning, but we are rewarded by the satisfaction of working our way into harbors under sail, thus sharing the experiences of the great explorers who first discovered many of the places we have visited. Sparkling clean bilges is the final reward, and a 14-foot oar allows us to scull Seraffyn at one knot on windless days. But we know that if we had to be “back to work” every Monday morning, Seraffyn probably would be fitted with an outboard motor.

-  Hitting flotsam
"  One evening, 50 miles off Punta Mala, we were just finishing dinner and Helmer was steering when we hit something, hard. We rushed on deck just in time to see a huge sea turtle shaking its head in our wake. Then, during our late-night watch, we hit something else. It wasn’t a turtle. A huge log rolled under the length of our keel, sending showers of phosphorescence in our wake. At such moments, we really appreciated Seraffyn’s 11/8-inch planking and long keel. Spring tides had scoured the shores, and whole trees were floating in the storm-tossed waters. For three hours, we kept a careful watch, until we cleared the edge of this tidal-flotsam line.

-  Bureaucracy from faraway US
"  “About four years ago,” he said, “the authorities decided that from then on all lights under U.S. jurisdiction would have to be powered by electricity instead of acetylene gas. So, instead of employing a local man to change the gas bottle each week, we had to install three generators, to guard against breakdowns, and now every six months we have to come here and ferry ashore 20,000 gallons of diesel oil in drums, through the reef. With all that, we still have to employ a local man to pull the switch each night. With the acetylene, we could just shove the bottles off Atlas and tow them ashore through the surf.” He shook his head.
"  “Then there’s the color of the light. With acetylene, this light used to burn pure white, and it was visible for 30 miles. The electric bulb burns yellow, and you’re lucky if you can see the light 22 miles away.”
"  As we arrived at the base of the 100-foot-high tower, we watched three teams of men on scaffolds painting from the top of the bolted steel lighthouse downward.
"  We climbed the spiral steps inside the tower, and the lighthouse keeper showed us the grandfather-clock–type winder with its 100-foot-long weighted chain hanging down the middle of the staircase. “The authorities also decided,” the man continued, “that we had to replace the old lens rotator with an electric motor. This light has burned since 1893, when the French built it here to guide their supply ships into Panama. It never missed a night in all that time. First month we had this electric rotator, it broke down, and the light was off all night. The local lighthouse keeper had to use the old wind-up rotator until we came out to repair the motor.”
"  The lens in the lighthouse was a beautiful thing. Hundreds of hand-cut, hand-polished prisms had been made and assembled in Paris. The lens weighed hundreds of pounds, but it floated easily on a sealed mercury bearing. The original mercury was still doing the work.

-  What's the right size for a cruising boat?
"  Suds and Carol had a little cruising boat and plans for a cruise someday. We sat on Seraffyn’s gently tilting deck discussing cruising dreams and reality. Suds pointed to a 30-year-old, 50-foot ketch that he said a young couple was trying to refit with almost no money. “What size boat do you think is right, now that you’ve been cruising for two years?” he asked.
"  I went below and got the graph we had made from the 67 “ideal cruising boat” surveys we had completed during the previous year. “We questioned the people on every yacht we met who had been cruising foreign waters for more than six months,” Larry explained. “People who had cruised for more than one year had boats that averaged 30 feet on deck; the ones who had cruised for more than two years, without any independent income, had boats that averaged 29 feet. That’s not just our opinion, but the actual statistics supplied by people who are doing the cruising.”
"  Carol studied the chart and said, “We’ve watched dozens of heartbreaks right here. I’ll bet not one person in a hundred who buys a big cruising boat ever goes off for more than a month. And those people over there, they’ll never have enough money to outfit that 50-footer, let alone take off.”

-  Why not upgrade to a larger boat?
"  Waldon Jones arrived from Florida with the Green Machine, and he joined Larry and Lyle for a sail on Seraffyn. They came back chilled, but Waldon was beaming. He had just asked Lyle to design him a larger version of Seraffyn.
"  “Aren’t you ready yet for something a bit bigger?” Lyle asked us that evening.
"  “She takes us and all our stuff where we want to go,” Larry said, “so why stop sailing for two or three years just to build a bigger boat?”
"  I passed the plate of grilled oysters as I said, “When it’s too cold to live on Seraffyn, it only costs us $70 to $80 a month to rent a cottage like this. For that amount, we couldn’t even start to build a boat big enough to have a fireplace. Besides, I wouldn’t be able to sail a boat much bigger by myself.
"  “And then there’s the cost,” Larry said. “We only have to work about three months a year to pay for cruising in a 24-footer. If we went to a 35-footer, we’d be working four or five months for money, plus a month extra on the boat. I like sailing, not working, so I’ll stick to little Seraffyn.”

-  Boats fresh from the factory need work
"  A month later, we had to fly to Miami to deliver the first two of the three boats we had agreed to handle. It was a jolt to fly from the cool, rural atmosphere of Urbanna straight into the heat and humidity of Miami without the “padding” of a sailing voyage in between. Then there was the shock of delivering a new production boat. I’d been on several delivery jobs before, but all of them had been racers, tested and outfitted by their owners, or motor cruisers on their way home against wind or current after a long cruise.
"  It’s frightening to step aboard a new, fresh-from-the-factory boat and take it to sea. The ads look great, but they don’t tell you that most of the things you see in them are “options.” Our first boat had no anchor, no bucket, no chain, no door latches, no bilge pumps, loose hose clamps (leaky hoses), no cotter pins in the rigging. It took us two days of shopping and inspection to get that boat ready for sea.
"  The owner had bought the most boat $35,000 could buy; to us, it was no bargain. We made a 1,200-mile beat in her, in winds of up to 50 knots, and by the time we reached Puerto Rico, we had a list of 28 broken items, including poorly installed chainplates, a structural bulkhead that fell out when we started going to windward, and household electrical fittings that became damp and shorted out after three days at sea.
"  The second delivery was a different boat from a different builder, but the same story. It made us feel that when you buy any new boat, particularly production fiberglass, it’s a case of “buyer beware.” A beginner, buying a boat for the first time and lacking experience, certainly should hire someone who knows how a boat should be put together to survey the boat beforehand. It may seem like an added expense, but what the buyer learns will save him money in the long run and help him get a good boat.

-  Not all stainless is created equal
"  In the evenings, Larry spliced new wire rigging. We had bought first-quality American stainless-steel wire for Seraffyn when she was built. Now, only two years later, it was rusting, and some of the strands were unlaying. In Jamaica, we had been moored next to a 10-year-old English yacht whose stainless wire rigging glowed like new. Larry wondered why ours wasn’t like that and, on a hunch, took a magnet from our portable chess set. Our wire grabbed the little magnet and held it; the English wire didn’t attract the magnet at all. So we took the magnet with us when we drove to Norfolk to look at wire in various chandleries. All of them offered wire that grabbed the magnet. Finally, in disgust, we ordered 300 feet of quarter-inch 7x7 stainless rigging wire from Jeckells of England. Five years later, that wire is still like new.

"  We worked like devils for two weeks and relaunched a like-new Seraffyn, glowing in white, varnish, and blue. After transferring our possessions back to the boat, we added up our hours of work—almost 500 hours. If a shipyard had done the work, it would have cost nearly $3,000—more than a year’s cruising expenses. Materials came to $400, including hauling charges. Once again, we blessed our small boat, which we could maintain ourselves.

"  The barometer was still dropping. Under the pressure of the fierce wind, the waters of Chesapeake Bay were being pushed southward—right through our harbor. The current must have been five or six knots, and it held us beam-to the building seas—parallel to the ferry dock. I crawled forward along the deck, tasting the salt of tears or spray, I didn’t know which. Larry had to shout instructions right into my ear. Seraffyn rolled her bulwarks under—first one, then the other. And then the 1/2-inch nylon anchor-chain snubber snapped! Larry let out more chain. We now lay to a scope of 11:1. Together we rigged a line that would let us turn Seraffyn stern-to-wind if we decided to slip our anchor chain. Larry rigged an anchor buoy to throw over if we did leave, so that we could return later for our ground tackle. Then we triple-reefed the mainsail. What a job that was! It would have been impossible without lazyjacks!

By the time the squall passed, the seas were nearly calm again and the sun came out. The wind died, and 20 minutes later we were cautiously setting more sail, bit by bit. Two hours later, I wrote in our log: Beam reaching under lapper, staysail, mainsail. Speed five knots, perfect sailing.

-  Anchor out vs marinas
"  We often prefer to anchor out, and we’ve found very few places where we couldn’t anchor for free. Rowing ashore is a small price to pay for all the benefits: It’s cooler; people from shore don’t track oil and sand onto our teak decks; the water around us is clean, so we can just dive in for a swim. And, it’s easier to anchor than tie to a dock: no fenders, no mooring lines, no chafing gear. Anchoring off is quieter, too: No one tries to bring his boat alongside or tramp across your deck at midnight. But mostly, we like the privacy. It’s disconcerting to have dockside loungers staring down your companionway as you change into your swimsuit. More than once, when we’ve been trying to sleep, we’ve heard someone on the pier say, “I wonder if anyone lives in that boat. Do you think they really sailed from Canada in that?” (I always want to rush on deck and shout, “Yes!”)

-  How to cook at sea without getting burnt
"  I am always amazed at how much interest people express in what type of stove to use, and how little they worry about preventing burns at sea—probably the most frequent medical problem on a yacht. I know of one woman who was deep-frying some food on a gimbaled stove. The boat lurched and threw her against the stove. It tilted toward her, and the pot tipped the boiling oil onto the front of her wet-weather gear. She had to be helicoptered out to get treatment for third-degree burns. She was lucky; the accident happened during a transpacific race, and there were escort vessels nearby to render assistance. On a small cruiser, sailing alone, there may be no help available for weeks.
"  The best safety precaution, we feel, is a proper galley layout. A stove located so that the cook faces forward or aft as he or she works is much safer than a gimbaled stove. When the boat rolls, any spilled liquid will go to port or to starboard, not on the cook. Deep pots will do as much good as gimbals, and reliable pot clamps will free the cook’s hands for other work. Good handholds for the cook, lots of hotpads on a handy hook, a sink right next to the stove for quick disposal of overflowing pots, a safety harness to hold the cook in place, and a niche in the galley to keep the crew from bumping into her—these are all features worth having. I’ve been very lucky so far—only the kinds of minor burns that any shoreside cook might suffer. Seraffyn’s galley, without a gimbaled stove, is extremely well planned for safe and convenient cooking.

"  Three weeks slipped by. It was the middle of July and we had at least 3,000 miles ahead of us, so we ran back to St. George and restocked with fresh food. With a 1,900-mile voyage ahead (to the Azores), I was especially careful in my selection of fresh vegetables. I bought green tomatoes and wrapped them in newspaper, and did the same with lemons. I bought four cabbages, six cucumbers, and more onions. We still had eight dozen farm-fresh eggs from Virginia, and I turned over each carton every three days so they stayed perfect for three months. I found some canned Camembert and Brie in the market; we came to consider the cheese a real treat. We filled up our tanks with water, butane, and kerosene.

The motion in a Force 7 sea was enough to keep us from doing any jobs that weren’t essential, and the spray kept us off the deck. It was most comfortable lying in our bunks. Our library was being rapidly and enjoyably depleted.

I set out a batch of bread to rise while we lounged on settee cushions in the cockpit. We made love in the sunlight and perfect tranquility of our own special island. We listened to the sounds of the gurgling wake. It seemed a miracle that two average people like us could experience such a moment of perfection in this world. What other kind of life could offer us so much variety—such changes of weather, such an intimate look at the moods of the sea, such variety of towns and cities and deserted coves? What did it matter if occasionally I was seasick? A bout only lasted a day or two. Who cared if we met some storms? They were only the smallest part of our sailing. We had the world in the palms of our hands. We had each other, we had our 24-foot playpen, and we had the time to enjoy whatever came: lots of time and no schedule at all.

-  Small boats must be defensive to avoid freighters
"  The next evening, we were back aboard Rode Zee. Crews from most of the 10 yachts in port were there, chatting with the crew and officers and filling the laundry room. At first, Captain Kalkman was quite serious. “I worry about you people on small yachts,” he said. “It’s so hard to see your lights at night. If I were you, I would keep a very good watch. Even with a man on watch on a ship’s bridge, you are still in danger. If that man only turns to fill his coffee cup while the ship is moving at 16 knots, your lights can be missed. You must stay out of the ship’s way. In fact, if I were singlehanding or had a small boat, I’d have a big white flashing light at my masthead, no matter what the International Rules of the Road say. All ships would avoid you then.”
"  Somebody asked, “Don’t most ships stay in the shipping lanes?” Captain Kalkman laughed before answering. “Shipping lanes were designed by men behind desks,” he said. “What prudent captain would take his ship through the fog and icebergs of the North Atlantic when 200 miles south he could have clear sailing? No. Shipping lanes or not, you should keep a good watch at night. Sleep in the daytime; a sailboat is easy to see then.”

-  Storm at sea
"  Almost all fronts are presaged by an increase in the size of the waves, often leading the wind by as much as several hours. OUr front, being brand-new, gives us no warning. We are suddenly hit with the strongest winds we’ve ever encountered. Even with the small amount of sail area we have up, we’re slammed all the way over onto our beam ends. Time and experience have taught Nancy and me how to gauge the speed of the wind, but beyond a certain point it’s hard to be objective. Nancy presses me for a number, and I say “In excess of 65 knots.” A nasty bastard.
"  I tell Nancy to stay aft in the cockpit and handle the sheet and gaff preventer while I go forward and try to pull the mainsail down. Fortunately at this stage the wind is still gustings, as it’s only between the gusts that I can make any progress. It takes me 20 minutes to haul the sail down, sort of furl it, and tie two ties to hold it. The wind blows more steadily, but with even more force, until moving about on deck becomes impossible. Getting the staysail down is, I decide, too dangerous. I retreat to the cockpit.
"  Nancy goes below. A wave breaks over the boat and tries to snatch away one of our lazarette hatch covers. I catch the cover just before it goes overboard, and nearly go with it.
"  Even with only the tiny staysail up, the strongest gusts are laying us over at a frightening angle. I figure that if _Sea Foam_ should founder, our chances of taking to the life raft are zero.

-  The wind has changed
"  When you’re sailing along and the wind suddenly comes from another direction, you say “the wind has changed.” To me this means the wind, tiring or blowing from one direction, has decided to blow from another. The change would occur even if the boat were not standing still. The idea that the wind where you were has _not_ changed, but that the boat has crossed the border between Eastwindland and Northwindland, for example, had never occurred to me--after all, in most cases the distinction is academic. In our case it was not.

"  Cook’s Bay was a fully protected but comparatively deep anchorage, and I had dropped our anchor and 200 feet of chain in 60 feet of water. It was a place where the bottom dropped off quickly. More scope and we’d have swung too close to shore. Furthur from shore and we’d have had to anchor in 100 feet.

-  Two approaches to boat maintenance
"  There are two schools of thought regarding boat maintenance. The first is the school of Diligence. Dils, or Dillies as they are sometimes known, make a constant effort to keep their boats in perfect condition. A Dil’s boat is never unkempt, but unfortunately its appearance is so cherished that the boat is never used.
"  Initially we were Dillies. The biggest risk in going sailing was not that we might hit another boat, or blow out a sail, or risk the rig with an unexpected jibe. The biggest risk was that we’d scuff the brightwork. A scratch on the varnish, a smudge on the topsides, a tiny strak of rust--any or all would send us into fits. Soon, instead of sailing, we were spending most of our free time in self-improvement, trying to patch up our personalities, to save each other from falling into depraved nitpickery. And failing.
"  The second school is the Prodigal School. Prods stray away from the paths of the righteous by letting appearances go. Prods are loose, and allow their boats’ looks to reach rock bottom before lifting a finger. Outcasts, they are not welcomed back into the Dilly fold until they see the light and complete the penance of rejuvenation. The greatest thing about the Prods approachs is that between marathon efforst there is plenty of time for sin (sin being a Dilly’s term for ‘having fun’), and the change from grungy to gleaming is always so dramatic that it cheers the most jaded soul and can even masquerade as progress.

"  I never could learn to welcome trouble, which is silly. Trouble faced at a time and place of your own choosing is far better than a surprise attack at sea during a storm. But why should I get into the grimy bilge to inspect the electric bilge pump? Turn it on, and if it works, leave well enough alone. Never mind that the bilge pump hose might have worn through (a rat once ate a hole in ours), the wires frayed or that the bilge might have accumulated a kind of debris that made clogging the pump a foregone conclusion. Twice our pump clogged up at sea in rough weather. Once a matchbox had worked its way down from a locker. Another time, sawdust from a project in the forepeak made its way aft. Both times, which being tossed about by seas and working up to my armpits in sloshing bilge water, I had the chance to reflect on how much easier it would have been to take care of the problem in the sunny sanctuary of our last anchorage.

In his book, _Song of the Sirens_, Ernest K. Gann revealed himself to be a nautical traditionalist and confirmed ascetic when it came to comfort or amenities at sea. Have admitted the he had a SLOB aboard his 115-foot yacht, _Albatross_, he went on to describe lying in his bunk and wating a can sway back and forth over his body. The can was suspended by a harness of marline. Drips that otherwise would have fallen on Gann, fill into Gann’s can instead. Every hour and a half the can filled up, whereupon Captain Gann would arise, carry his can to the sink, dump it, and return to his bunk. For an indefinite period, at no time during wet weather did Gann get more than 90 consecutive minutes of sleep. Since reading his book, certain impromptu stopgap remedies aboard our boat have been dubbed “Gann Solutions.” And it was Craig, I believe who coined the phrase, “If you can’t fix it, Gann it.”

-  Bargain hunting is earning money by keeping money
"  When we first left California, we put aboard as many spares as we could afford and had room for. Some, after six years, we still had. Many has been used up, given away, lost, or had deteriorated into rusy shadows of their former selves. The result was that now, instead of merely raching into a locker for a spare, we had to (A) make it, (B) shop for it in whatever port we were in, or (C) send home for it. Choosing A, B, or C resulted in a Test of Ingenuity and Endurance (TIE).
"  Out early TIEs were in Tahiti, where we absorbed a full measure of Papeeian shopping lore. The first requirement was to keep enough money on hand to take advantage of bargains. Papeete shopkeepers used a pricing system based on a percentage markup. If subsequent wholesale prices increased, only new inventory was affected. On the dusty, remote shelves of many stores, old inventory that wasn’t affected by shelf life represented handsome barginas. I once bought a dozen U.S. fuel filters at half the current U.S. price (one-third the Papeete price). Even though we had little spare money, we never regretted it. We also left Polynesia with over 100 sheets of wet-and-dry sandpaper. The price in some shops was 50￠a sheet. We bought ours for 15￠a sheet. At a time when my sweat and toil was bringing in $15 a day, we had just saved (earned) $35.

But the trouble with our 'thing hunger' was that it was neurotic--i.r., could never be satisfied--and not only were we unslaked and unsated, but we were also constantly nervous about out deficit finances. There are people, I've heard, who can use credit cards as conveniences and not as vehicles for compulsive buying, but I've never met one, and if I did I probably couldn't relate to him.

-  The virtues of the Crealock 37
"  The Crealock is narrow, with a stern that pinches off like a second bow, which means that the interior space for people and supplies is less than that of a similar-sized boat of more modern design. The stern and bow each overhang the water, which again reduces the interior volume. But those overhanging ends and that narrow beam also give the Crealock a motion at sea that isn’t comfortable, since no small boat is comfortable at sea, but rather much less uncomfortable than it could be. In nearly every aspect of the boat, designer Bill Crealock seemed to hit the same golden center that he did in this tradeoff between interior volume and seakindliness. For almost every characteristic you can measure, the Crealock 37 falls precisely halfway along the continuum between an America’s Cup racer and a coal barge. And in all that moderation Crealock worked a tiny bit of alchemy. He produced a boat that in many situations can exceed what you would expect of it. In light wind it sails a bit faster than you’d expect, in steep waves it rides a little more smoothly. This is the sort of je ne sais quoi that puts a twinkle in the eyes of people who work in the practical world of boats. And the Crealock is also one of the more beautiful fiberglass boats out there. If your sailboat cannot be a little beautiful, what is the point?

Dall’s are black and white porpoises that have the couch-potato physiques of the cetacean world – their bodies are too thick to be called sleek – but they are reputedly among the fastest of all cetaceans, the tiniest flick of their flukes accelerating them to speeds that send sheets of water spraying up into the air.

I would jump out of my snug sea-berth and clamber up the companionway steps, half asleep and wondering what had woken me up. Out in the cockpit I would see only the faint glow from the compass at the binnacle, the wind and speed instruments over the companionway and the masthead light waving its constant arc beneath the black sky. Everything above would be stars and the negative space of clouds. On both sides of the boat invisible water would rush by with a hiss. One of the really neat things about the low freeboard and narrow stern of Pelagic was how immediate the ocean felt at times like that, how intimate. But I also experienced a brief shudder of realization whenever I stepped sleepy-headed into the cockpit at night, especially if we were heeled over so that the black water was below me. That water was death, pure and simple. If I fell in I’d never be found, and looking down into the water as I stood in the sloping cockpit, one hand on the dodger and the other on the steering pedestal, gave me the same sort of feeling that you get from looking down from some ghastly height.

"  Ever since leaving Alaska we had been prone to let-downs after completing passages. When places like San Diego were our landfalls, indifferent harbors that we were visiting just because they were on the way to somewhere better, it was easy to blame the destination. But there is also an effect of stepping away from the simplicity and purity of life at sea, and back into the complications of life ashore, however briefly, that tends to bring the group vibe crashing down no matter how wonderful the destination. As many landfalls as we may ever make as a family, I trust that there will be nothing quite like that end to our first long passage. Making landfall in the Marquesas is such an evocative moment for aspiring world sailors, since it means that you are no longer a neophyte, but a bona fide ocean sailor able to safely navigate across thousands of miles of open ocean on a small boat. The Marquesas are also the first Polynesian islands that a sailor making the tradewind passage across the Pacific reaches, so getting there means that your dream has suddenly become real – you are about to spend months sailing downwind through the most beautiful islands on earth, not someone whose exploits you read about in a sailing magazine.

Not leaving port on Friday is more of a maritime tradition, one that was strongly established on many of the commercial fishing boats that we had been aboard in Alaska.

-  LFMM: battery changing
"  While Alisa was trying to change us from the starter battery to the house batteries she moved the circular switch from battery #2 to battery #1, but went clockwise, through OFF, instead of counterclockwise, through BOTH. This was a feature of our electrical system that British sailing magazines call ‘fail dangerous’: if you switch the battery switch to OFF while the engine is running, even for a teeny moment, the electricity generated by the alternator has nowhere to go, and the alternator blows up. So the alternator blew up.

-  The best advice
"  We knew several boats that were finishing their cruise across the Pacific with the wife flying ahead to New Zealand and the husband sailing the passage with friends or casual crew. It’s hard to overstate how different this was from our approach on Pelagic. Different things work for different people, but we couldn’t imagine setting out on a trip that we knew in advance wouldn’t be sailed by both of us. Pelagic only went where both of us wanted to go. With the boat being so much our home, and the adventure so much the current version of our shared lives, there was no other way. Which brings me to the answer that I had rehearsed for anyone who might ask for advice on sailing the world on a small boat. You could do it without my wife, I would say. But I wouldn’t recommend it.

"  “Thank you for the loveliest Christmas,” Steve says as he kisses me goodnight. It was the loveliest Christmas—and I had been worried about it being lonely and disappointing, far from family and friends. But in our phone conversations back home, everyone, to a person, had described how hectic the season was: how rushed they were, how tired, so much to do, the shopping, wrapping, baking, decorating, cooking, partying. And I realized that only by sailing a couple of thousand miles away had we succeeded in gracefully escaping the usual competitive celebrating. Instead of doing frantic last-minute holiday preparations, we went to the beach on Christmas Eve afternoon, where we blissfully swam (and finally painted our registration number on the new Snack). I baked just one type of Christmas cookie, not dozens, and—limited by what I could find in the local markets and Receta’s storage lockers—made unelaborate goodies to take to a Christmas Eve gathering on a neighboring boat, and to Sue and Dennis on Christmas day. People still gobbled them up and asked for the recipes. This was the simplest Christmas ever, and we loved the feeling.

-  Harbors can still be dangerous
"  There is one aspect in which life at sea and life in port materially differ. At sea, a sense of danger, an idea of insecurity, is ever present to the mind; in harbor, a sense of security lulls the sailor into indulgence. He feels perfectly safe. Yet, even in harbor, danger sometimes visits the fated ship, stealing upon her like the spirit of evil. This remark was fearfully illustrated in the loss of the Royal George, which sunk at Spithead, near Portsmouth, on the 29th of August, 1782. This splendid line of battle ship, of one hundred and eight guns, had arrived at Spithead. Needing some repairs, she was “heeled down” or inclined on one side, to allow the workmen to work on her sides. Finding more needed to be done to the copper sheathing than was expected, the sailors were induced to heel her too much. While in this state, she was struck by a slight squall; the cannon rolled over to the depressed side; her ports were open, she filled with water, and sunk to the bottom!

-  Pay on a man-of-war
"  The practice of paying seamen at long intervals, is the source of many evils. Among these, is the opportunity given to pursers to practise extortion on the men — an opportunity they are not slow in improving. The spendthrift habits of most sailors leave them with a barely sufficient quantity of clothing, for present purposes, when they ship. If the cruise is long, they are, consequently, obliged to draw from the purser. This gentleman is ever ready to supply them, but at ruinous prices. Poor articles with high prices are to be found in his hands; these poor Jack must take of necessity, because he cannot get his wages until he is paid off. Hence, what with poor articles, high charges and false charges, the purser almost always has a claim which makes Jack’s actual receipts for two or three years’ service, woefully small. Were he paid at stated periods, he could make his own purchases as he needed them. The sailor is aware of this evil, but he only shows his apprehension of it in his usually good-humored manner. If he sees a poor, ill-cut garment, he will laugh, and say it “looks like a purser’s shirt on a handspike.” These are small matters, but they go to make up the sum total of a seaman’s life, and should therefore be remedied as far as possible.

"  An instance of maternal imprudence was said to have occurred in this port on board another ship. A poor woman went on board and inquired for her son, who had run from the British service, and was then among the captive crew of an American prize. They told her there was no one of that name among the crew. “He is among the Yankees,” said she. Hearing this, the prisoners were called up, and the poor, affectionate, but ill-judging mother, singled out her son, and embracing him, said, “I have brought you a clean shirt!” The lieutenant, who stood by them, stepped up, remarking to the thunder-stricken man, “It’s a clean shirt you want, is it? I will give you a clean handkerchief” — meaning that he would be hung. The unhappy youth was accordingly ironed, in presence of the astounded mother, who now beheld herself the unintentional murderess of her son. A court-martial was held, and the brutal prediction of the lieutenant verified.

-  No lifejackets off shore, singlehanded
"  The prospect of being left behind as the boat sails away vivifies the singlehanded experience and requires every sailor make a deal with himself. I don’t wear a life jacket offshore because there is no chance of immediate rescue. A harness keeps me with the boat. They’re not infallible, and last year a trimaran was found speeding across the Pacific with nobody aboard, a broken tether streaming off one hull.
"  A harness is worthless if you don’t wear it, and so I decided years ago to keep mine on all the time when alone. I would like to say that the reason was some exciting brush with sudden death, but it was simpler than that. One night at home I sat on the side of the bed at midnight just to watch my wife sleeping. I was departing in a few days and would be gone all summer, leaving her to take out the trash and guess the passwords of our Internet accounts. I wondered what I could do to make her part easier. The answer was to come back, which would save a good deal of inconvenience. And the way to accomplish that was to wear the safety harness all the time. Sleep in it, wake in it, dine in it. I would clip in before climbing out of the cabin, and unclip only after climbing back in.

They’re designed for a crew to handle, although singlehanded racers fly them too, day and night. To wander off course downwind under spinnaker can mean a racing-car spin out—a broach—in which the boat rounds up, the chute collapses violently and the boat winds up on its ear, with everybody yelling. Happens to my solo racing friends all the time. At night. In 30-knot squalls. With nobody to yell at.

-  On choosing abilge pump system
"  The submersible bilge pumps I have always had, and which the new boat had too, are often not self-priming. They need bilge water to work, and when drained dry they don’t. They’re famous for whining happily and making tiny bubbles while moving no water at all, a condition surprisingly difficult to recognize as bilge water slops back and forth over them. Since nobody wants standing water in his boat, a one-way valve is often inserted in the line to keep hose water from running back. The better it works, the faster the pump loses its prime. A one-way valve in a bilge hose is a terrible idea anyhow, since it can clog.
"  Thelonious II came with two such check valves, one for the main bilge and one for the separate shower bilge. The main bilge valve worked too well—the pump wouldn’t pump unless the bilge remained half full. The one-way valve for the shower was a mass of human hair. No water passed at all, and it has been that way for years.
"  However, cutting out the one-way valves presents a problem. Most bilge hoses have no anti-siphon loop, so without a check valve the hose can siphon water back in under some points of sail.
"  How to resolve the conflicts of centrifugal pumps?
"  A diaphragm pump is the alternative. A centrifugal pump spins an impeller to move water, but a diaphragm pump expands a rubber membrane to draw fluid in, and expel it with the next stroke. The diaphragm design has two check valves built in, so there is no possibility of siphon. They are installed in a dry location, not submerged, and draw bilge water in through a hose. They move fewer gallons per hour than a centrifugal pump, but can run dry without failure.

-  Why are goosenecks always breaking?
"  My theory is that our stock goosenecks are being overstressed by modern rigging practice. In the 1970s, when Kenyon spars and Ericson Yachts were churning boats out, lines were not typically led back to the cockpit. It was common to rig the main sheet in the cockpit, or at the end of the boom, where it put relatively little strain on the gooseneck. Many boats were sold without boom vangs, which were considered optional. Reef lines were cleated to winches on the boom, or held by reef cogs. None of it added stress to the mast-boom connection. But nowadays, with our controls led to the cockpit, consider the downward vectors a gooseneck has to handle: a main sheet and reef lines, both often winched to hundreds of pounds of tension and a vang that makes strong compression as well as downward force. Aft control of outhaul and topping lift add yet another pull-down component. All of that strain goes on two cast-aluminum ears. I doubt the designer of the original gooseneck would approve. What can we do about it? Inspect and monitor. Maybe pat the gooseneck once in a while, and say something nice. It’s a fitting not to be taken for granted.

But we’re links in an ancient chain if only because we have stood watch too and seen the evening star Venus yield to Phosphorus, star of morning. What we know that the ancients didn’t is that they’re the same planet. But the link still holds.

-  Adding inspection ports to fuel tank
"  Our fuel is carried in a trapezoidal aluminum container built to fit the tapering shape under the quarter berth. It is a sealed unit with a filler hose installed at the stern. The only other orifice is a 3-inch hole for the fuel gauge. The tank is covered by ¾” plywood further reinforced with fiberglass tape. To clean it, inspection ports need to be installed.
"  I sawed out the floor of the large double berth using a circular saw. I removed the fiberglass tape with a grinder, and there lay exposed the shiny aluminum tank. Then I emptied the shop vac, swept up the debris, changed the filters on my half-mask respirator, vacuumed the whole boat and took a long shower.
"  Using my trusty 50-year-old jigsaw I then cut three six-inch holes in the top of the 1/8th” aluminum tank. Diesel fuel is not very volatile, so hot metal shavings falling into it is not worrisome unless you have never done it before and are relying on the advice of people whose personal scar tissue is unknown. Nothing blew up.
"  The holes came out fine, and we are now free to call them “inspection ports.” In the illumination of a flashlight, the floor of the tank was seen to be coated in slime and glop, just as expected. An hour with rags and soap and a vacuum cleaner and the tank was spotless.
"  To cover the inspection ports, I had a metal shop make three 8” round plates. With these I could close the 6” holes, drilling and tapping for stainless machine screws of 32 threads per inch. In 1/8th” aluminum that gives nearly four threads of holding power. After carefully calculating the screw locations, I drilled them using the new drill press this project was the excuse to buy. I made a fine job of each cover, a perfect concentric circle of 17 holes 2” in from the edge.
"  However, if you make an 8” cover to cover a 6” hole, and drill the screw holes 2” from the edge of the cover, you will discover, as I did, that you are an idiot. The screws go into the hole, not into the tank. The solution is easy: don’t tell anybody.
"  Stealthily I returned to the metal shop and ordered three new 8” covers. These screw holes I made 1” from the periphery. The embarrassing covers I hid under some 25-pound barbell plates in a corner of the garage where nobody would ever find them.

-  Are fuel tank inspection ports necessary
"  There is an argument to be made that inspection ports are unnecessary. Why not just install two separate Racor 500-series fuel filters in the engine compartment? Filters can then be changed prophylactically. If one should foul, keep running on the other. That’s easier than cutting holes in a perfectly good tank just so you can look inside. But confidence is having a clean fuel tank.

"  Floating junk is obvious, but beneath the keel the insult to the sea is worse. Becalmed a few days ago I lowered a camera on a stick and brought back a video of tiny swirling dots. Seaweed? I slipped in with a mask to look further and was back up the boarding ladder in less than a minute. As far down as I could see, about 200 feet into crystal Pacific water three miles deep, a maze of particles glinted in the rays of the sun. They were all bits of plastic. I sail on a slurry of microplastics, swim in it, cook spaghetti with it and pour it gloriously over my head at noon in the cockpit. Every bucketful was defiled in my own lifetime. Plastic degrades only slowly. In the absence of sunlight and water it may not degrade at all.

-  Boat owners are caretakers
"  Sail power, once the engine of ocean commerce, is now an aesthetic. Yacht brokers pitch the sailing “lifestyle,” by which they suggest club ties and boating parties and a set of elegant friends. Most of the owners I know are more likely to hand you a wrench than a wine glass. Despite simplified navigation, powerful winches and easy maintenance, sailing remains a hands-on thing. An owner is a caretaker of his yacht for the time he owns it, and the experience is more of duty and responsibility than personal glory.

"  No dodger. I’m often asked about my lack of a dodger, that familiar semi-permanent tent over the companionway hatch. I can only suggest trying life without one. Dodgers are assumed to be standard equipment, but should they be? They interfere with the view forward, complicate winches and clutches, add windage and too often look mismatched to the yacht. Their role is to give protection against wind, spray and rain for the companionway—which already has a watertight sliding hatch. How much protection they actually provide varies by yacht and dodger design. In cold and rainy climates a dodger may be necessary, but to my mind it is always a necessary evil.

The boat will be my home, my transportation, and life-sustaining capsule. If I want to carry more water, I have to sacrifice a second fuel tank. Building a small navigation table means losing the port-tack sailing berth. Which do I bring, a spare mainsail or my beloved 5'9" squash tail surfboard? The choices seem infinite and there is never one simple answer.

A saltwater still? A backup GPS? Overboard bag? Is the electrical system grounded properly? How will I receive weather information? Is there redundancy in all the major systems?

-  Description of Cruisers
"  “Cruisers” is the accepted title given to people living and traveling on small boats for extended periods of time. Some have taken a sabbatical from work; for others, it’s a permanent lifestyle. We see the same faces often, as most boats are heading south and share the same window of time to get to safe hurricane-season destinations. Most cruisers are much older than Shannon and me, seeing as it takes resources to buy and maintain a boat. There are occasional “in-betweeners,” in their thirties and forties, often with kids aboard, and a few male “single handers” here and there. But the majority of cruisers are retired, salt-of-the-earth couples who never intend to return to land and know every trick in the cruising book—from covering their eggs in Vaseline to make them stay fresh longer, to pirating the latest electronic charts, and knowing which clothespins actually hold drying clothes on the lifelines. He’ll always have advice about fixing things and she can sew curtains and cushions and whip a delicacy out of a few simple ingredients.
"  People go cruising for various reasons. Some relish the everyday “sunset happy hour” that starts at 5 pm on one or more of the boats in a harbor. There is usually an open invite as long as you bring your own booze. Others, like the scuba divers and shell collectors, or surfers like us, do it to enjoy their watersports or hobbies. Many just love sailing and the ocean, and living free and disconnected from society. They all have stories to tell, some louder than others. At almost every bay, a cruising wife—likely dying to talk to someone other than her husband—organizes a potluck get-together, spreading the word via the VHF radio. Whether the potlucks are on the beach or on one of the boats, these eclectic events are the social fabric of cruising life. As diverse as they come, cruisers are almost always helpful, good-willed, and frugal. There is one golden rule—always do your best to help another cruiser in need—because inevitably at some point, you’ll need help too.

-  Seeing tuna ships in a different light
"  We are sure our good fortune with kind sea neighbors has run its course by the time we reach the bay at Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. But the next day we’re invited to tour a Venezuelan tuna ship. I’ve always thought of these purse-seiner operations as evil—being a big cause of the decline of the oceans’ fisheries. It was hard not to marvel at the huge tuna-killing vessel’s internal processing and storage systems and the helicopter on the top deck used to spot the giant tuna schools that they can capture in a single day, but the massive holds full of frozen fish unsettled me. Thousands of motionless tuna eyeballs of all sizes stared back at me, even haunting my dreams that night.
"  Over dinner, the friendly fishermen showed us photos of their families, and elaborated on the fun they’d have with their kids when they returned home. They are good guys, just trying to make a living like everyone else— cogs in a global economic system based on oil and growth and pushing for the harvesting of more and more resources, faster and faster, before the other guy gets to them. The general lack of respect and understanding of our connection to nature with which European men colonized the world has perpetuated a greedy, me-first mentality that keeps a few rich profiteers finding faster, more efficient ways to catch tuna, clear forests, extract oil, and propagate industry without regard for the health of the ecosystems on which they capitalize, much less the finite nature of our planet. Progress they call it. But as Barry and I would often discuss, humans depend on Earth’s fine-tuned systems for survival, so “progress” that pushes nature out of balance does not truly advance us. But then, I’m no eco-angel either; I gladly accepted the ten gallons of diesel they offered me. I’m part of the problem too.

A thin layer of neon blue fends off the imminent darkness. Deep purple settles over the rest of the sky. Scattered planets appear.

"  The obligation to steer has multiple rewards. Hands on the wheel, I’m engaged in every gust, every passing cloud, every lifting wave, as Swell and I surf down the following seas. I find the sweet spots in her old sails and learn more about her every day. Plus, maneuvering her through mile after mile of dynamic ocean, I become an active participant in the scene. As the waves pass beneath us, they pull the rudder right or left, and my arms strengthen in the long hours at the wheel. I gaze out at the ocean panorama: ever-changing, ever-wondrous. I follow wavelets on the sea surface, the teeny ones stacking upon the next, always in hot pursuit of their mates up ahead—until suddenly they are both overtaken by a much larger wave, and swallowed in a gurgle of white foam.
"  Subtleties surface each hour as the day progresses. At every angle of the sun, the rays play on the water and clouds in their own exceptional way. Sunrise and sunset steal the show, but midmorning’s fresh rays uplift, high noon’s brilliance astounds, and mid-afternoon’s bending yellows soothe and foretell day’s end. When the last remnant of the sun’s glow disappears, we are suddenly sailing through the unbridled heavens— perpetual, sublime, infinite, mysterious—always reminding me that no matter how much I think I understand, I know so very little.

Time spent soaking up the regurgitations of television was reduced to nearly nothing. The days all had a purpose. We were pushing joyfully toward an absolutely unrealizable goal: the perfect boat at a price we could afford.

Besides, at that time the cost of a blue-water insurance policy to satisfy a lender equalled the cost of six months’ provisions. For us, the loan route would have been a final desperate measure after all else had failed. We chose to pay for the boat, and as a result we later suffered a lack of ready cash, but it was the right choice for us. We could always spot the installment buyers.

"  “Hon?” said Nancy. Her smile was sweet, her voice silky. “I need $300.”

"  “Provisions,” she said briskly, and within minutes she departed, taking Conni as co-advisor, and stealing Philip, Chris, and Craig as bearers. We’d already spent several hundred dollars on provisions, but we had raised the waterline three inches, after all, and I wasn’t really worried. Beamy Sea Foam, I was sure, could hold tons. That evening the $300 was gone, and deckhouse, decks, and cockpit were buried under cartons of food. For several days we varnished cans, made lists, and discovered nooks and crannies under bunks and behind bulkheads, spaces heretofore unused. I was told to build a spice rack two feet wide and three shelves high. It turned out to be too small. Then came phase two. "  “Hon?” said Nancy. Her smile was tentative, her voice pleading. “I need $200.”

-  Windvane vs self steering
"  Sea Foam’s crew, after several months aboard, complained at not having a self-steering vane. We have a friend who, when his children point wistfully at the windvane on other boats, informs them sternly that standing watch is character-building. In our case it was sailor-building. Chris, Phil, and I had a modicum of experience. Craig, Conni, and Nancy had none. By the time we had steered Sea Foam all the way to Tahiti, everyone aboard had learned the rudiments of sailing. Each had learned how to steer by the compass, how to spot threatening squalls, at what point to reduce sail, and how to assume responsibility for the boat and her crew. And each had experienced the impressive loneliness of night-watches when one is a pinpoint on an empty ocean, a microdot in an eternity of stars.
"  Much later, Nancy, Craig, and I delivered a boat, equipped with an excellent self-steering vane, from Tahiti to Los Angeles. It was a totally different experience. Even though we maintained a watch schedule at night, the person on duty only had to go topsides three or four times per hour to check course, weather, running lights, and the horizon for other ships. We called it a responsibility watch.
"  During the day, with the vane, there was no formal watch, and only very casual supervision was maintained by whoever felt like maintaining it. The vane steered the boat faultlessly to the apparent wind. Sometimes I had to force myself to leave my cozy bunk to go topsides for ten minutes in the morning, ten in the afternoon. I would stand in the companionway, breathe deeply of the pure air, scan the horizon for survivors to rescue (not too many, please), and then return below to book, chart, or typewriter. Whereas without a vane, man retains his close relationship to vessel and sea, much like the symbiosis of rider and steed, with a vane the relationship degenerates to that of a passenger to his seat on the bus. The purist in me says “steer,” but whenever our ship’s company dwindles to its hard-core complement of three, the realist in me says “vane.”

-  Fire at sea
"  “What happened?” I gasped.
"  “I’m not sure,” said Nancy, hands clasped to her chest to keep her heart from beating its way to freedom. “I was priming it, and the boat took a sudden lurch. The alcohol spilled out of the cup into the pan underneath—it’s done that before, lots of times—and I was just getting a glass of water to pour on it when the whole stove kind of exploded.”
"  The stove itself was a gimballed three-burner with oven. Under the top burners was a tray of metal (actually the top of the oven) so that if alcohol spilled out of the priming cup it should have been harmless even if allowed to burn itself out. The problem was that, because the stove was gimballed, it was connected to the remote tank by a flexible, clear plastic hose. Notoriously susceptible to heat, the hose would melt when the flaming alcohol flowed anywhere near it. Once melted, fuel under pressure squirted out the hole, and a voracious tongue of flame, unquenchable until the main valve could be turned shut, shot out to engulf the galley.
"  It was several weeks before I was able to acquire a piece of fire-resistant refrigeration hose to replace the clear plastic one, and in the interim we had two more fires, both in rough weather. With practice, however, we learned to shut the valve quickly and quench the fire with minimum devastation. We’ve since learned a trick which would have been helpful. Take a short piece of asbestos rope and make a coil filling the priming cup. The asbestos wick soaks up enough alcohol for an effective prime, and prevents the liquid from sloshing out. Not knowing this at the time, however, we lived tenuously, as if on the lip of a rumbling volcano.

And Craig and I have watched, with cruel glee, while Nancy sleepily put a pinch of instant coffee into my cup, a heaping spoonful of tea leaves into hers, and then proceeded to fill the sugar bowl with boiling water. Given the human material that engineering would have had to cope with in our case, I was of little faith, and took the only precaution I knew against the hazard of propane, which was to refuse to have it aboard.

-  Diesel in a nutshell
"  Diesel engines are basically simple. There is no carburetor, no electrical ignition system. Fuel, filtered to pristine purity, is pumped under high pressure into the cylinders through injectors, which are essentially atomizers. There the vaporized diesel oil is compressed to such pressure that the temperature rises enough to ignite it. After combustion, the transfer of energy to the drive-shaft is exactly as in a gasoline engine.

Our biggest enemy was boredom, which we combatted by reading, playing games, kibitzing at Craig’s morning school sessions, cooking new dishes, watching porpoises, catching fish, debating (some cynics might say arguing), taking baths on deck in a child’s inflatable dinghy, swinging in a bosun’s chair slung at water level from the bowsprit, writing daily in our journals, putting sunburn medication on previously unexposed skin, and for practice doing more navigation than necessary.

"  Because they are geologically young, none of the Marquesas have coral reefs. All anchorages are open coves and bays—interruptions in the island’s perimeter—and as such are vulnerable to bad weather from certain directions. We were anchored in Hana Vave Bay, on the western side of Fatu Hiva, a deep indentation in towering granite protected from all but westerly weather. Because of the trade winds, 90 percent of the weather came from the east, and the bay was calm and sheltered. The island’s height, however, could cause gusts to scream down from the mountainside at speeds of up to 60 knots. These williwaws lasted only about a minute. Their sudden violence tested our nerves, but they were also bug-eliminators, and before we finished cruising in the Marquesas we came to wish that all the bays had them.

-  Trust your navigational instruments, not hunches
"  Hunches are apt to be downright dangerous when it comes to navigating. It’s best to check your navigational instruments regularly, and then trust them, no matter how strongly your intuition dissents. I learned this once and for all in the Gilbert Islands in 1977. We were approaching what we thought was Tarawa, middle island in a north-south chain of three close neighbors. Tarawa, however, was a port, and as we drew near we could see no boats, no pier. It had to be the island to the north or to the south of Tarawa. The lay of the land and the fact that we couldn’t see Tarawa to the south (the tip of the island was blocking it from our view) had me convinced that we’d raised the southern island. My conviction was undeniable and dead wrong. Even though a sunshot put us north of Tarawa, indicating an incredible three-knot northerly set, the illogic of that possibility blew my cool. As a result we wasted three hours sailing north instead of south, and finished by spending an unnecessary and unpleasant night at sea trying to keep a lighthouse in sight while hove-to in 30 knots of wind. Had I trusted the sextant, we’d have been comfortably in port that afternoon.

In subsequent conversations with other yachties I discovered that all Old Anchorage Residents (OARs) feel the same way about newcomers (Newks). During the time that a Newk is anchoring, the mutual assistance pact to which most yachtsmen subscribe is put in abeyance. Newks are watched by OARs covertly but attentively, and how a Newk copes will determine his acceptance by the OARs even more than when or how long he runs his generator.

-  You need several tenders
"  In spite of all we had read on the subject of cruising, we completely failed to grasp what the life is actually like until we’d lived it for a while. People cruise at different paces, just as people live at different paces ashore; but we, and by far the majority of cruising yachts, have observed the following. 1) Nine out of every ten days, month after month and year after year, are spent at anchor. 2) Once moored, anchored, or tied up to a quay, a tremendous inertia keeps you there. Things that are lashed for sea are unlashed, and things that have special places for a passage are left out for convenience. Half-finished projects lie on deck under tarpaulins. 3) As a result of (2) it requires anything from a half-day to three days just to ready the yacht for a day-sail. A day-sail in protected waters is most sailors’ favorite diversion, but because of the effort required to ready a yacht-home-workshop for an outing, the majority of cruising yachts tend to stay put. Taking these factors into consideration, we’ve come to the conclusion that a cruising couple needs several tenders. Number one should be a small inflatable, a light, stable utility boat to be propelled primarily by rowing. Number two should be a fiberglass dinghy designed for sailing, with the largest hull you can carry on deck. Number three: a planing inflatable with a husky outboard. Four: a surf-sailor. Five: a kayak. Six through ten: whatever else you can cram aboard. Admittedly, this solution is expensive, but freedom and mobility are two of the objectives that drive most of us to sea. If you are like we are and spend 90 percent of your time at anchor, the only answer is a veritable fleet of small craft.

Sitting at the helm, you responded to the push and pull of the waves entirely by feel. You couldn’t see the bow, let alone what was ahead of you. You took it on faith that you had a clear way. The alternative to this form of faith was madness. And if you hadn’t done your homework on the integrity of your boat, you gained firsthand knowledge of hell. Daytime was almost worse. Looking over his shoulder, the helmsman could watch a mountain of water bearing down on the stern like an implacable avalanche. Time and again it would seem as if the wave had to engulf us; but each time, Sea Foam’s broad counter lifted skywards, allowing the huge, angry mass to flow harmlessly beneath us. At first it was as if each wave was testing Sea Foam to her limit in a desperate struggle for survival, but as she continued to rise buoyantly over wave after wave, we realized that she was taking the seas much more in her stride than we were. And when we finally were able to run more downwind, the motion of the boat and the task of steering became easier.

"  “Happy to make your acquaintance. I’ll be out, tomorrow or the next day. Got a little problem with the generator.” At least that’s what I think those engine-room sounds said.
"  In Hiva Oa our friendship progressed slightly. I got a good close look at his shoes and the legs of his blue jeans to the point that I was sure I could recognize them again. The conversation, however, bore a close resemblance to the one we had in Fatu Hiva.
"  “Sorry, old man. Just gotta get this hot water heater fixed. Maybe tomorrow we can chat…”
"  It was in Taiohae, Nuku Hiva, that we were invited aboard for cocktails. Both Nancy and I looked forward to meeting Roger. (By this time we’d met his wife, Betty, several times.) Roger, so far, was a faceless myth, a rumor of essence, the only ectoplasmic verification of which was shoes and jeans.
"  The evening went very well, considering. Betty, Nancy, and I sat around the teak table in the saloon making overlapping rings with our beaded, chilled glasses. At one point I left the party and went forward. There, completely exposed except for his head and neck, lay Roger, curled around the base of his kerosene reefer.
"  “How ya doing, Rog?”
"  “Gotta fix this goddamn icemaker,” he quipped. The rest of his remarks were swallowed up in the coils of the compressor.
"  In Ahe we ran into Roger and Betty again. On the night of the feast we rowed by their boat to see if they would like to go ashore with us. Betty accepted our invitation brightly. Roger stuck his head up out of the main hatch. Except for a sunless pallor and a vaguely haunted look, he had a rather pleasant face. "
"  “Wish I could go with you guys,” he said, “but I gotta fix the goddamn radar.”
"  “You don’t need radar to go to a feast,” I told him.

"  We all ended up, months later, in the lagoon at Punaauia on the island of Tahiti. We aboard Sea Foam had grown fond of the delightful pace of life and love in the South Pacific. Roger’s boat, however, was a hub of activity. On board were at least two, sometimes three, full-time geniuses whose jobs were to repair or to install a microwave oven, a larger freezer, generator, dishwasher, laundry, autopilot, and what have you. Roger, freed from the actual labor, spent his evenings on the radio calling for parts, his days in Papeete running from store to store, customs to airport post office to freight depot. He finally bought a motorcycle to save time parts-hunting, and every morning, bright and early, the last thing you would see of Roger was a cloud of dust out of which flapped the tail end of his list. The time he saved by having his own transport he spent maintaining his motorcycle.

Pegeen was the largest boat I had ever set foot on. My total navigation experience consisted of using a hand bearing compass maybe three times. I was thirty-six years old and, apart from a little tennis in London and sailing the Mirror, had not had any real exercise in fifteen years. It seemed a meager chronicle of assets. But I had others. I was reasonably bright; I had a little money; I had about nineteen months to find a boat, learn to sail it, learn to navigate it, and to get fit; and above all, I was, just about as much as any man can be, free.

But I was learning an important lesson—that the sea doesn’t care when you arrive, or if you arrive at all. The sea is indifferent to the desires of those who sail upon her, and no amount of sulking or swearing will change that. One learns patience at sea, and always the hard way.

-  Landfall after a long sail
"  We staggered ashore under the weight of an incredible amount of laundry for two people, borrowed the staff shower at the Estalagem de Santa Cruz, a lovely modern hotel built inside the walls of an old fort next to the Club Naval, then, cleaner and more closely shaven than we would have dreamed possible, tucked into a lunch of fresh tuna (I had always thought they were born in cans) fried in batter, local grapes and cheese, and a cold bottle of the native white wine, Pico Branco (the local red wine is good, too, if you don’t mind your teeth turning blue), all of it a welcome change from the tinned food on the boat.

-  A sailing yarn
"  One of the most interesting people to sail into Horta was Laurie, a wiry Aussie with an impenetrable accent and a wide gap between his teeth. He had a story to tell about that. Leaving Virginia Beach, in the United States, for Horta, he had been caught in a hurricane, then come down with an abscessed tooth. Unable to stand the pain, he had sloshed down some whisky, then taken a drill and a self-tapping screw to the roots of the tooth, when it had broken off in attempts to pull it with vice-grip pliers. While he was lying semiconscious in his bunk recovering from that, a supertanker nearly ran him down, scraping his little boat along the entire length of the huge ship’s hull and pulling out his mast and most of his stanchions. He had restepped the mast and repaired his rigging at sea, then sailed on to Horta.

"  The boat’s speed increased immediately from two to three and a half knots, more when the wind puffed a bit. Fred steered perfectly, the sun shone, and I had the best sailing I had ever experienced, lying naked on the deck with a glass of wine and soaking up the sun while Harp took care of herself. This was a totally sybaritic experience and was the time when I most wished I had someone to share the trip with. Randiness began to set in.

-  Never know how far from other people you actually are
"  Now I had day after day of free sailing. On the eighth I was making six to seven knots in ten to twelve knots of following wind when a very embarrassing thing happened—or, at least, it would have been embarrassing if there had been anybody there to see it. I got a bad spinnaker wrap; my Irish tricolor all-rounder wrapped around the forestay in the middle, while remaining full of wind at the top and bottom, giving the effect of an overengineered brassiere sticking out in front of the boat. I tried everything I could think of to free the sail, but it refused to unwrap and it began to look as if I would have to climb the mast to unwrap it from the top. It was mid-afternoon and I decided that since we were still making a good speed I would leave things as they were until it began to get dark. If the spinnaker hadn’t unwrapped itself by then, and I fervently hoped it would, then I would go up the mast and free it. In the meantime, a beer seemed a good idea. After all, I was in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, and there was nobody there to witness my humiliation. Why not relax?
"  Five minutes later a Dutch naval vessel, HMS Zuiderkruis, turned up and, after making radio contact, the operator’s first words were, “Can we assist you in clearing your spinnaker?” I said I could handle it, and after getting a position and a weather report and ascertaining that they had picked me up on radar at a distance of five miles, I went on deck, shamed into climbing the mast. I waved goodbye to the ship and started up. After ten minutes of swearing and struggling with the bloody thing, it finally came unwrapped, and as the big sail filled I was startled to hear a loud cheer. I swung around to look behind me and found the ship stopped, her entire crew hanging over the rail, applauding. She gave a loud hoot on her horn and was on her way again. So much for privacy in single-handed sailing.

-  Df. broach
"  When a boat “broaches to” when running before the wind, she suddenly veers and tries to point into the wind, ending up beam-on to the seas and the wind. This can be very dangerous, and Harp never quite performed the maneuver. What she did do was begin to broach, then correct. Fred, like any self-steering gear, could not anticipate the action of a following wave the way a helmsman can. He could not correct the boat’s direction to allow for a wave which was about to change it. Rather, he would have to wait until he felt the yacht beginning to change direction, then correct. This resulted in a sort of “mini-broach,” in which the yacht would start to veer abeam to the wind, then resume her proper course. The effect on the occupant of the boat and the contents was much like that on the occupants of a car which, traveling at, say, forty miles an hour, suddenly and sharply swerves to avoid another car backing out of a driveway, then continues down the street. If I were standing, cooking, for instance, when the mini-broach occurred to port, I would be tossed across the cabin to land on (or under) the chart table. This is not as much fun as it sounds.

"  Finally, late Monday afternoon, I made one last assault on the mast. I ran the boat off to steady her as much as possible, got into a harness, and started laboriously up the stick, clipping one of the two stainless-steel carbine hooks onto a higher step before unclipping the lower one. That way if I slipped I would always be hooked onto something, although I didn’t relish the thought of swinging around like a pendulum from a rope clipped to a mast step. I stopped at the crosstrees to rest my hands, which were already very tired from gripping the steps so tightly, then continued.

I staggered about the cottage, babbling incessantly to Nick and Heather. I could not stop talking. We had dinner at a local restaurant. The thing I had missed second most on the passage was food cooked by somebody else, served on a white tablecloth, with cloth napkins. I talked all through dinner and straight through till bedtime.

"  My back problem had begun to abate now, after more than three months of pain whenever I stood up or walked for more than two or three minutes at a time. The lower back pain had extended to the sciatic nerve, which runs from the hip down to the foot, then given way to severe muscle cramps which continued for some weeks. I had been to two more back specialists; one had given me muscle relaxant injections which helped somewhat; the other had told me just to wait and it would go away, and he prescribed a very embarrassing, steel-braced corset to be taken on the transatlantic crossing in case the fractured disc slipped out of place again. Having always been extremely healthy and unaccustomed to severe pain, I lived in terror of the thing recurring in mid-Atlantic.

"  This was a depressing situation, because it meant that when the charge remaining in the batteries was exhausted there would be no electrical power left on the yacht. This would mean no VHF, no cabin lights, no instruments, no stereo tape, and, worst of all, no navigation lights. I would still have radio reception for weather reports, radio direction finding and entertainment on the battery-operated Brookes & Gatehouse and Zenith radios, and depth sounding on the battery-operated Seafarer but no log for speed and mileage recording, no wind direction or wind speed, and no off-course computing from the Hadrian. I had gone to such pains to ensure that I had the best possible battery charging system, extra-large batteries, two alternators, etc., and now here I was without electrical power because I could not start the engine, a possibility that had never occurred to me. A thousand pounds’ worth of electrical and electronic equipment was now useless. I went over the whole system again, afraid that I would arrive in Newport, somebody would point at a loose wire and say, “That’s your problem.” There was nothing loose, and apart from that I didn’t know where to begin.

"  Large whaleboats were used throughout the colony to haul copra from shore to ship. Such service was severe, for the boats often had to go through the surf and sometimes capsized, and there were always eight or ten bashed-up whaleboats awaiting repair at the boatyard. Often the boats would sink, and as they went down the copra bugs and cockroaches would scramble higher and higher. Whenever a whaleboat foundered near us the horrible insects would begin to swim toward Whisper. I had always thought that cockroaches would drown, but I can assure you that the two- and three-inch brutes can swim well. We seized oars and fought them off, repelling the odious invaders with vicious smashing blows against the hull and water.

"  Without doubt the social acceptance we got in many places depended largely on the fact that Margaret and I were doing something that represented a dream to many people. The romantic delight of sailing at leisure from one island to another is enormously appealing, and during our Pacific trip hundreds of people told us that they too had similar plans—uh—someday. A parallel consideration of such a trip pivoted upon the needle point of fear. Many people told us they would like to make a similar journey but they were obviously afraid of the sea. When I tried to explain how small-ship sailors worked to minimize the hazards of the sea by careful planning, I got only stares, hesitations, and vague answers. Or to say it another way: Most people like the known, the positive, and the certain. Our friends on land distrusted what we said about the dangers of the sea. When I said that storms were infrequent and we tried to be where the gales weren’t, my listeners didn’t believe me. When I suggested a coastwise trip for a starter, I saw heads slowly shake. Their minds were made up in advance. Twice I invited keen schoolteachers to come with us to Guam to try out an ocean trip; neither the man nor the woman accepted. Yet the fascination with our trip continued.

When I gestured toward several villages and called out the names, the Japanese sailors would smile and nod. If I indicated a detour around a danger with my hand they assented eagerly. If I questioned the depth of the water in a nearby harbor I got immediate motions to indicate how many men high the water was deep. If I shook my fist at an approaching squall the fellows on the other ship knew exactly what I meant. In short we were all from the sea, and though from different cultures, we understood and helped each other, for one never knew who would need help tomorrow.

"  Dr. Tanaka hired Watanabe, one of Japan’s leading naval architects, to design a new 33-foot sloop for him. Tanaka employed Okazaki, a small shipyard on Shodoshima, to build the yacht. But in order to afford all this, something not common in Japan, Tanaka works very hard and has a practice so big that he cannot find time to enjoy his ship and certainly not to go away on a long or even a short cruise. His life is a paradox, as are the lives of many Americans, sort of quivering ulcers, who in order to afford something they want very much, must work so long and hard that they have neither the time nor the energy left to enjoy their hard-won gains. Perhaps their salvation would be to reduce the height of their goals a trifle. … Maybe a 30-foot yacht instead of 33 feet. And must it be double-planked with expensive teak on the outside?

We marveled at the patience and resourcefulness of the hard-working Japanese farmers who grew such splendid crops in the rocky soil. If the weather or the season was too cold for strawberries, for example, a little bamboo frame and plastic cover was fitted over each plant, which was tended with what seemed almost like adoration. The islands were timeless and blemished only by the national curse of Japan: plastic. On every beach and road, in every river and harbor, in every estuary and pond—everywhere—we saw plastic junk. Plastic toys, plastic buckets, plastic bags, plastic everything littered the shores and roads and lanes in wearying windrows which will never disappear.

We threw packs of American cigarettes across and soon the whole crew—in long underwear shirts and with towels tied around their foreheads—had lighted up and was smiling.

The wind was now dead aft and the head of the ship yawed from side to side in the turbulent water. The mainsail gybed with a crash and threatened to gybe again. A bell rang in my head and I remembered a lesson I had learned from Ed Boden in the South Pacific. When you are running hard with the wind directly aft and it’s impossible to change course, pull the mainsheet in tightly and ease the headsail sheet. You retain control of the ship and have the mainsail up and ready for use in case of need.

-  Dangers of relying too heavily on engines
"  The engines in cruising yachts get larger each year (along with electrical complexities) and a whole new school of cruising, a group that misses much of the spirit of the sea, it seems to me, is growing up. Instead of being sailors, these captains have to be journeymen mechanics and financiers to keep ahead of the repairs and the bills. Everything is engine, engine, engine, more and more fuel tanks, long distance radios, pressure hot water, washing machines, radar, Loran, and so on, ad nauseam. I think you can make an interesting distinction between (1) a pure sailing ship, (2) a sailing vessel with a small auxiliary engine, and (3) a motor vessel with auxiliary sails that are used when the wind is favorable, a sail-assisted vessel. I believe that most accidents happen to category number three because many owners of so-called “full-power auxiliaries” are not sailors and don’t know how to maneuver and control their ships under sail. These yacht owners often have no concept of storm management, how to sail an anchor out, how to heave to, and so on. Instead of knowledge they rely on engines that may work or may not.

If your heart isn’t in the sea you will never leave the safety of the land, a pity perhaps, but not many people have the fire of adventure in their bones. But if you want to go don’t wait until everything is perfect or you’ll never get away. Most adventuring is done on a shoestring. Perhaps that’s part of the fun.

The very nature of exploration, pioneering, and adventure is quest and curiosity, not safety and security.

He saw us set out on the Pacific trip, return, edit a film, write a book, give lectures, and now he sits and watches the parade of visitors from the Pacific climb onto Whisper.

-  Description of Savai'i
"  In Apia we had talked with several schoolteachers from New Zealand and they had asked us to call on them at Avao on the north coast of Savai’i. Since the charts were poor we made inquiries about Matautu Bay on which Avao fronted. We were assured that it was well sheltered with a sandy bottom in which our anchors would hold well. Late in the afternoon of November 21 we eased Whisper’s sheets and glided into Matautu Bay. The anchorage, however, was open to the north, and where the water shoaled over the white sand, big swells formed that thundered into white spray on the fringing reef farther inshore. The weather was settled and the barometer remained high, so we anchored the ship, tidied up her gear, and prepared to go ashore in the dinghy. “Look what’s coming,” said Margaret, looking shoreward. “I hope they’re friendly.” A fleet of thirty outrigger canoes had set out through the surf and was rapidly closing in on our little ship. I thought that if we pulled away in the dinghy the fleet might follow us and leave the ship alone. But as I rowed toward the reef the canoes converged on Whisper. I felt that my little ship was Captain Cook’s Endeavour in Matavai Bay in Tahiti in 1769, for while she rolled merrily at anchor the primitive canoes surrounded the ship and the husky, dark-skinned natives swarmed on board. The scene would have made a wonderful photograph, but of course I had no camera. I turned to look at the swells bursting on the fringing reef and realized we would have to ride a wave across the coral barrier. In the twilight the approach seemed quite hazardous and we would not be able to get back to the ship until morning. I looked back at Whisper and saw one of the Samoans dancing up and down the decks with a life ring around his neck. I wondered whether someone had sliced off the mainsheet. I swung the dinghy sharply around. “Sorry,” I said, “but this is one place we’re leaving.” As soon as we got aboard I began to winch up the anchor while Margaret hoisted the mainsail. As we began to move seaward the canoes gradually left us. Savai’i faded into the dark.

"  It was dark when we touched the shore, but the sand on the village beach flared up from the harsh light of kerosene pressure lamps held by several men. We were suddenly aware of a crowd of perhaps seventy-five to a hundred people watching us. Ioane led the way to the small headquarters office of Abemama—the crowd followed—where he produced and dusted off the visitor’s register, a large bound book. I opened it and saw that it had been started in 1946. In more than twenty years only a handful of outsiders had come to the island. I signed my name at the top of page three. “Are we the first yacht, Ioane?” I asked. “I think so,” he said. “I have never seen one before.”

-  Lin knocks over a can of varnish
"  As spring grew closer, we set to work on Seraffyn’s refit. Larry was busy doing some alterations to the cockpit, so I sanded the starboard bulwark and waterway, dusted it, got out the paint, and started to put it on. I’d removed the ventilator that leads into our chain locker so I could paint around it more easily. With atrocious luck and no small amount of clumsiness, I knocked over the half liter of white paint. Then I let out a shriek as half of it poured down the ventilator hole and the other half ran in a stream down the bare teak decks. “Larry! Get me some kerosene, quick! Rags! Paper towels! Rush!” He came forward to see what was causing the ruckus, looked down at the mess quite calmly, and said “Excuse me.” Then he walked off the boat. I ran for kerosene, took one look into the varnished chain locker with its liberal dose of white paint, scrambled back on deck, poured kerosene on the teak, and started rubbing. Just then Paul Lees and his girlfriend Vicky arrived. “Where is Larry?” Paul asked. I looked up from my frantic work and pointed toward the end of the pier two hundred yards away where Larry was yelling at a flock of seagulls. “What is he doing?” Vicki asked. I guiltily answered, “Shouting at the gulls instead of me.” The white paint wiped easily off the varnish of the chain locker. But in spite of scrubbing with a gallon of kerosene, spots of it still decorate the teak deck four years later.

"  We hauled and painted Seraffyn at the ever-helpful Parkstone Yacht Club, disposed of our rattletrap car, had farewell dinners with wonderful winter friends. Then, laden with stores, we set off for the Baltic on the fourth year of our cruise. A dozen people had come to see us leave and yell good wishes. We set our lapper and mainsail, then reached out of the Poole Town Quay with a fair tide under us. I waved until we couldn’t make out any faces while Larry steered through the intricate maze of buoys and stakes marking the shoal patches. “That’s the one thing wrong with our way of life,” I told Larry when I finally went below to start lunch. “You meet wonderful people who invite you into their lives. Then before you know it, it’s time to leave.” “Maybe that’s good,” Larry answered. “We stay just long enough to learn the good things about people and we leave before they learn our faults or we learn theirs.”

-  Heating the boat leads to a near tragedy
"  Both of us felt terrible, nauseous and headachy. I had a bad bruise on my chin. We realized we’d almost poisoned ourselves by having an unvented fire on board with too little air circulation. I’d been affected more drastically because carbon monoxide sinks and I’d sat down in the main cabin while Larry hadn’t. We’d been okay in the forepeak because we were near the chain locker with its three-inch ventilator and open chain pipe. We rowed into the clubhouse to have lunch and mentioned our episode to one of the members. “Even if your gas heater had been vented, you could have been in trouble. Last year, someone heard a baby crying on board one of the twenty-six-foot charter boats tied at the side of the canal. They went to investigate. The boat was all closed up, but not locked. When they opened the hatch, the investigators found four dead people sitting around the table with a half-eaten dinner set out. The remains of a charcoal fire smouldered in the stove with its one-and-a-half-inch flue. The baby was in the forepeak, right next to the open chain pipe. That’s why it was still alive.” Our frightening experience and this sobering story made us realize that any fire in a closed area such as a boat is dangerous. To prevent loss of oxygen and the buildup of carbon monoxide, you need cross ventilation even if you have a smoke stack. After this, we kept a quarter berth ventilator and the skylight open every time we used our cabin heater.

-  How to be a bigger boat on radar
"  Larry hoisted the sail and I couldn’t believe my eyes. From the reefpoints up our brand-new sail was grimy gray. We’ve since washed that sail in hot soapy water, but nothing has taken the stains out. Friends have suggested that the stains were caused by industrial pollution carried from the Ruhr Valley in Germany by the strong easterly winds. Others say the stains are from diesel exhaust fumes off the oil-rig generators. But we’ll never know. By afternoon our third day out, we were close-reaching slowly along on an almost flat sea with fog surrounding us. A few times that night we saw ships’ lights and were able to estimate that we had one-mile visibility. We have aluminum foil rolled inside all the hollow sections of Seraffyn’s thirty-eight-foot-high wooden mast and the captains of two ships have told us that our picture on a radar screen looks like that of an eighty-five-footer. That’s probably why ships never came near us during any foggy periods.

-  Canned food diet could lead to B-12 deficiency
"  Larry did not have kidney stones. Although the Finnish doctors cured his stomach pains, it was not until we were leaving Poland that a doctor found the real cause of his recurring problem: “Vitamin B-12 deficency. I used to see hundreds of cases during the war when flour was unavailable,” the Polish doctor told us. It turned out that the high cost of meat in Scandinavia which had encouraged us to have a shipboard diet consisting mostly of canned food, combined with the fact both of us were trying to lose weight and so had avoided all bread, noodles, potatoes, and rice, had produced this deficiency. The results of a few vitamin tablets were nearly miraculous, and we became instant believers. Now, whenever we are at sea, away from the variety of fresh foods offered on shore, we take a vitamin supplement, as do many long-term cruisers.

"  I was ready to settle in for the winter. Larry called it my nesting urge, but I was really looking forward to staying in the same place for a few months. I looked forward to doing my grocery shopping in the same stores each week and coming to know who had the nicest vegetables, or where to get the spices I wanted. I needed the friendly feeling of being recognized and greeted by the local merchants and maybe joining in a coffee klatch for a bit of female talk of recipes, sewing, and homemaking. These breaks in our cruising life were a refreshing change, and after three or four months my desire to move was always stronger than ever before.

-  Married life in close quarters
"  my mother looked at our tiny home coming to rest at the mooring across the river and said, “How do the two of you live together twenty-four hours a day in such a small home? Don’t you miss your privacy? Don’t you get bored with each other?” I tied to explain that the two of us were drawn closely together by the shared work required to take care of Seraffyn and voyage in safety and comfort. With our common interests, we never seem to run out of things to talk about—places we’d like to go, people we’d like to meet, things we’d like to do, changes we’d like to make to our floating home, things we’d like to write about. We didn’t have the outside pressures caused by jobs, mortgages, and a hectic social life that steal time from the average shoreside couple. Because we couldn’t easily hide from each other, we had to face our personal problems and work them out way before they grew too big to handle. We had the time to really communicate, uninterrupted by telephones or life-insurance salesmen. Despite our limited living accommodations, we’d learned to find the moments of privacy everyone needs. Larry would say, “Excuse me for a few hours, I’m going to read a book.” Then he’d climb into the forepeak or lounge back against a sailbag and I’d work happily away in the main cabin or row ashore for a walk. Every year or two we’d arrange to spend three weeks or a month separate from each other. This sometimes happened naturally such as it had during the Round-Britain Race. At other times we chose a convenient meeting spot so that one or the other of us could take a trip inland to visit friends or go sightseeing while the other enjoyed having Seraffyn all to himself. We’d use the time learning not to take each other for granted, and I know I always came back appreciating our partnership more than ever. About once a year when we’ve stayed in the same harbor waiting for weather to clear, mail to arrive, or a check to be cleared, one or the other of us becomes short-tempered or generally obnoxious. But we’ve come to recognize this as a disease we call “port fever,” and since boats are made for going places it is simply cured—we set sail and move somewhere new. Now, four years later, after we’ve lived on board for over nine years, we are busy scheming and planning a new boat we might build some day. As we do that, I realize that our shared projects and mutual goals are the reason we rarely get bored with each other.

Within four hours of the height of our “quicky” storm the wind lost its force as it became blanketed by the hills, and within another hour we were almost becalmed.

-  "You can't buy safety"
"  We’d often discussed safety harnesses and always carried two in a convenient place in Seraffyn. But, as a good friend once said, “You can’t buy safety. You have to earn it by learning good sea habits.” Safety harnesses are a great assistance if you happen to be wearing them at the right time. But in practice few people wear them every minute of the time they are at sea. Good hanging-on habits, strong and convenient handholds, and the awareness that death is only one misstep away are just as important and will stop you from falling overboard when there is an emergency that gives you no time at all to find and put on your harness. The time in the Baltic when we were suddenly broached, Larry didn’t have a safety harness on—it was good hanging-on habits that saved him.

   look at a boat for me? I know enough about boats to look her over myself. Don’t
   worry, I’ll be careful before I spend my money.”
"  Larry shook his head and explained, “I built my own boat and spent ten
   years repairing other people’s boats, and I’d still employ a surveyor. That
   way a disinterested person would be double-checking it for me. He wouldn’t be
   prejudiced by having fallen in love with some beautiful but possibly rotten
   old classic. He might catch all sorts of things I’d miss. Besides, I’ve
   rarely heard of a good surveyor who couldn’t save you at least the cost of
   his fee when it came to negotiating the final price.”
"  Jan and Nigel went away that evening discussing Larry’s words. They came
   back the next day and told us they’d made an offer for the Vertue, subject to
   survey. They’d refused to use the local surveyor suggested by the owner’s
   agent and instead hired one from out of town. We watched the surveyor at work
   the next day and he was good. His hammer and awl searched everyplace you
   might expect to find trouble. He pulled every sail from its bag. He climbed
   the mast, carefully removed several fastenings from the hull and pieces of
   ceiling from the boat’s interior. Then he gave Nigel and Jan a typed list of
   all the defects he’d found and suggested a reduced offer. After the surveyor
   left, Nigel told us, “Best seventy dollars I ever spent. I learned seventy
   bucks’ worth just watching him survey the boat.

"  There are many advantages in living the same way when you are working as
   when you are cruising, by which I mean that you live as far as possible on a
   similar income, living on the boat, spending your money as you would when
   cruising. We always tried to do this and the idea behind it is that we were
   working solely for our freedom and therefore, any money spent on non-essentials
   meant that we had to work that little bit longer to gain our
   liberty again. Admittedly, we would buy ourselves more treats on the 'After
   all, we are working' principle, but they were bought in the full awareness of
   their being non-essentials and a step back from freedom. You need some
   compensations for going to work, but must never lose sight of what you are

   Because his gear will be smaller and easier to manhandle, be it storm trysail,
   sea anchor, warps, he might be ready to take preventative measures sooner.
   Because of his boat’s smaller size and generally shallower draft, the man on
   the thirty-footer would probably find more places of refuge available to him
   than the man on the forty-five-footer. Yes, the small-boat sailor will have
   to think twice before choosing to round the Horn or take a winter passage. He
   may choose to lay in port and wait out a gale the man in a forty-five-footer

-  The lure of returning to life on the water
"  We began to notice a strange fact. Our pleasure in the beautiful three-bedroom
   stone-floored house with its often-used grand piano seemed to
   diminish as our freedom fund increased. At first we loved having so much room
   to spread out, and often dined in front of the living room fire when the
   dining room table was covered with Seraffyn’s freshly varnished hatches,
   blocks, and bunk boards. But I began to tire of forever leaving the one thing
   I needed for my downstairs projects in one of the upstairs rooms. I began to
   resent having to vacuum and dust five rooms when we only used two most of the
   time. The delight of knowing exactly where to buy each thing I needed in the
   local shops soon turned to boredom when I never saw a vegetable that was new
   to me and never found a sausage I hadn’t tried before. The novelty of being
   able to go to a movie any time we wanted, or listen to live folk music at the
   local club, or hear a symphony orchestra soon lost their glamor when we
   always had to drive through the same streets to reach them. It took four and
   a half months of work before our cruising fund reached the minimum figure we’d set—three thousand dollars. The minute it was fifty dollars over, Larry
   finished up his last contract and quit working, and we knew it was time to
   migrate.

   like Seraffyn, boats we’d read about in books by Uffa Fox and Peter Pye. Not
   fifty yards away was the transom of Victory, a seventy-year-old Falmouth
   oyster dredger, her hull looking just like ours, but without a cabin. Her
   bowspirit was fourteen feet long at least, seven feet longer than ours.
   Instead of the tall Bermuda-rigged mast we had, hers was short and stout with
   all the gear of a big gaff sail. Not far from Victory lay two other oyster
   dredgers, one red, the other turquoise and black.

"  At 2035 our position was an estimated seventeen miles from Funafuti. We
   hove to until dawn, when we got under way again with dark clouds frowning
   across the horizon from west to north, just the direction we were headed. I
   wondered whether we would be able to see the low atoll, but at 0740 Funafuti
   showed up ahead. Rain plummeted on deck and it was too gusty to use the vane.
   The wind worked from dead aft to the starboard beam as a rain squall passed
   going northward. Goonies, shearwaters, and a bosun bird flew around the ship.
   We headed for a tower structure of some kind and held our course until we
   were about half a mile from a point of land where we suddenly noticed a small
   group of people watching us. One man waved a large red flag. Red flag! Was
   landing prohibited? Was there a danger of some sort? Had I broken a rule? It
   later developed that he was just waving it for fun.
"  [...]
"  Funafuti lies 510 miles south of the equator, almost astride the
   International Date Line, and is about 2,300 miles southwest of the Hawaiian
   Islands. The atoll measures eleven by fourteen miles and is shaped something
   like a man’s head facing west, his profile outlined with the dot-dash pattern
   of a broken reef surmounted here and there by palm-topped islets which total
   about thirty in all. During World War II, Funafuti was a U.S. naval base and
   I have seen a photograph with twenty capital ships at anchor. The cautious
   directions in the U.S. Pilot had evidently been written for these battleships
   and heavy cruisers, for we had no trouble at all entering the large lagoon.
   The Pilot glibly spoke of rows of buoys, leading marks, and beacons, but
   except for a stone marker on Funamanu Island all were gone. World War II was
   a long time ago. Inside, the weather improved, and in the calm lagoon we
   tacked back and forth up to the village of Fongafale where we anchored in the
   early afternoon while the Ellice Islanders lined the shore.

-  The best guarantee of independence comes from simplicity
"  I believe that one of the great pleasures that we derive from voyaging is
   that of independence and we have found that the best guarantee of that
   independence comes from simplicity. Take the yacht herself. If she is a
   sophisticated boat, with electronics, generators and high tech equipment,
   your independence will be reduced in relation to the amount of this equipment
   you can look after by yourself; if you need specialist help then you have to
   sail to a place where such help is available, which interferes with your
   freedom of choice. Indeed, essential maintenance in itself controls your
   actions. The less the necessary maintenance, the freer you are. Financially,
   you may be a lot better off by playing the money market than by committing
   yourself to one safe form of investment. However, life will become
   complicated by the necessity of keeping in touch with what is going on and
   the need to contact your broker. You’ll probably need some sort of
   communications system and then what has happened to the peace and
   tranquillity of a long ocean crossing? In short, the fewer things there are
   to go wrong, the less there is to worry about and the more time you have for
   sailing. Moreover, if there’s nothing to go wrong in the first place, then
   you won’t need to spend anything on putting it right.

"  To obtain the necessary wealth to go voyaging, the first thing that you
   have to do is decide how important it is to you to go voyaging because,
   quite simply, this will affect how much money you will need — if you want to
   go voyaging more than anything else, you will be content with very little
   money while you’re doing it.

-  "What would you give up for a life of freedom?"
"  Quite often, we talk to people about going off cruising and they will
   say, “If I couldn’t go out for meals or have a drink in a bar, I’d rather not
   bother, thank you very much.” Your first reaction might be to agree with them,
   but when you analyse the statement it is quite ludicrous. Are you seriously
   saying that you would rather carry on working than sacrifice the odd meal out
   and visits to bars? Are these things so important that you would trade them
   for the pleasure of living your own life on your own yacht, travelling to
   different places, doing things in your own time and having the time to
   appreciate the beauty of the world? If you feel that you can’t do without any
   of your ‘comforts’, perhaps indeed you prefer the dream to the reality. So
   many of the things that people regard as necessities are luxuries unheard of
   50 years ago. Many of them are in fact, society’s compensations for sending
   you out to work. When you are in charge of your own life, with the freedom to
   live as you wish, you don’t need these compensations.

"  You will no doubt have noticed that we carry quite a lot of chain on Badger.
   Originally, we decided to keep weight out of the bows and just anchor on a
   15-kilo Bruce, 40 feet of chain and then warp. However, we soon got fed up of
   Badger walking all over the place at anchor and went back to using mainly
   chain. Apart from the catenary effect which is due to its weight, another
   advantage of chain over rope is that it is unlikely to chafe through on rock
   or coral, thus removing one of the worries of anchoring in that type of
   bottom.

-  Sailing in and out of anchorages is challenging and rewarding
"  When the cost of miles covered has to be counted, few of us will switch on
   the engine to save time (“for what?” one asks). As with so many aspects of
   voyaging on a small income, this economy actually leads to more enjoyment and
   greater satisfaction. Any fool can steer a boat downwind across the ocean —
   the test of handling a boat is in sailing in and out of anchorages and
   because this is where the skill lies, this is also where the most fun is.
   Neither of us is that keen on steering, but when it comes to entering a
   harbour or sailing a tricky course among the skerries, we both enjoy it so
   much that we have to take it in turns to ensure fairness. Even more fun is
   sailing out, with the added challenge of making sure that you get away on the

"  Note the short boom on the sail plan of the Kaufman 47 (from the

   high-aspect mast is a carryover from the IOR rating rule. Mid-boom sheeting
   angles load the boom and make it hard to sheet, but it is a compromise I
   accept, and it’s definitely better than having the mainsheet run across the
   cockpit. Not only does this make it hard to move around the cockpit or go
   below, it makes it very difficult to rig a spray dodger. The sail plan calls
   for the boat to be sailed as a cutter, yet most are more efficiently sailed

   this boat had fallen through the cracks. Who else besides me would be
   interested in a Kaufman 47? Who else had even heard of it? I remembered
   reading a review when it was first launched, and I even remembered its
   nickname, “Taiwan Swan.” I read the listing carefully. There was not much
   equipment, but I didn’t care about that. Nothing is older than old gear on a
   sailboat, and the lack of equipment was actually a positive. I was more
   interested in the miserable blurry pictures and the tiny interior plan drawing.
   I enlarged them and studied them intently. The pictures confirmed what I
   already knew: the boat had the hull shape I was looking for—low and lean,
   almost ridiculously low, with a longish fin keel and a large rudder mounted
   well aft and tucked safely behind a substantial full skeg. The entry was
   knife like, and the wedge-shaped cabin trunk looked very much like a Swan.
