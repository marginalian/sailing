Whisky & Rainwater
--

- two parts whisky (bourbon or rye)
- one part dry Madeira wineMadeira is a Portuguese fortified wine. Avoid the cheaper varieties of Madeira, which are seasoned with spices. These must only be used as cooking wines. Instead, look for the "Rainwater" style, after which the cocktail is named.

Add campari to get a taste closer to a Boulevardier.

Add bitters for something like a Manhattan.
