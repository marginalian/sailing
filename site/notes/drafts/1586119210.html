  <div class='single-blockquote'>Although many of the new products have diminished much of the discomfort, hard work and worry of ocean sailing, the offshore environment remains much the same as it was when man first ventured into the unknown. This may explain why many of us are attracted to an often bizarre existence. Anyone who chooses a small boat over modern transportation to get from A to B does so for the experience, rather than efficiency or cost. In small-boat voyaging it's the journey that counts rather than the destination.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Trekka Round the World - John Guzzwell</div>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>The old-timers in the great days of sail come to mind: for centuries they furrowed the oceans in trade or discovery. But always for the sea. I reflect on what they bequeathed us in nautical documents, where words stand for the sea and sky, where arrows try to tell of currents and winds, of the anguish and joys of those sailors, as if that could be done, as if experience of the great laws of the sea could be passed along, as if the vibrations of the sea could go through you with only words and arrows.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;The Long Way - Bernard Moitessier</div>
