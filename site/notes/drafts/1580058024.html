  <div class='single-blockquote'>Three weeks slipped by. It was the middle of July and we had at least 3,000 miles ahead of us, so we ran back to St. George and restocked with fresh food. With a 1,900-mile voyage ahead (to the Azores), I was especially careful in my selection of fresh vegetables. I bought green tomatoes and wrapped them in newspaper, and did the same with lemons. I bought four cabbages, six cucumbers, and more onions. We still had eight dozen farm-fresh eggs from Virginia, and I turned over each carton every three days so they stayed perfect for three months. I found some canned Camembert and Brie in the market; we came to consider the cheese a real treat. We filled up our tanks with water, butane, and kerosene.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Cruising In Seraffyn - Lin Pardey</div>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>Margaret cooked on a two-burner Primus stove that used kerosene under pressure from a three-gallon tank. We had taken twelve dozen freshly laid eggs (which kept perfectly when coated with Vaseline) and generally had eggs and tea and toast for breakfast. Sometimes we ate cold cereal with milk made from powdered whole milk, which became a creamy, rich liquid when stirred with a little water. We often lunched on soup or bouillon and sandwiches made with tinned meat. We started off with eight loaves of bread, which kept reasonably well for several weeks. Margaret then trimmed off the moldy bits and made toast. When the bread got beyond salvage we heaved the remains over the side and changed to shipâ€™s biscuit.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Two on a Big Ocean - Hal Roth</div>
