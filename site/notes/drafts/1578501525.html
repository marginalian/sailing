  <div class='single-blockquote'>One would expect that women so remote from the world would seem dowdy and old-fashioned in their dress and manners. Certainly not, in Saba. Somehow the girls manage to keep up with the times. They are not averse to a few judicious touches of rouge and lipstick; their hair is bobbed in the latest style; they will smoke cigarettes and drink an occasional whisky and rain water; they know the new dance steps, as we later found out to our embarrassment, better than we; their dresses are as chic and stylish, although most of them homemade, as anything seen in the fashion books. How do they do it? That is one of the mysteries of magical Saba.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Blue Water Vagabond - Dennis Puleston</div>
