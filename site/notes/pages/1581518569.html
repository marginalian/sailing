      <h1 id='the&#95;lure&#95;of&#95;the&#95;ocean'>The Lure of the Ocean</h1><br />
      <p id=''>If you ask five sailors how to approach a boat project, you'll likely hear five different solutions. You're also likely to hear from each of them why the other four solutions are idiotic, over-engineered, under-engineered, or just plain wrong.</p>
      <p id=''>Sailors find much to passionately disagree about. Whether it's <a target='' href='../pages/1581654976.html'>boat size</a>, technologies, budget, etc. But once you cut through the superficial disagreements, there is a strong sense of shared experience and camaraderie among sailors. After all, they enjoy a shared heritage that can form common ground between disparate backgrounds, lifestyles, and experience levels.</p>
      <p id=''>Comparing notes across various sailing stories casts this point in sharp relief. Cruisers of wildly different backgrounds and generations write of their experiences in strikingly similar language. Boats, sensibilities, and cultural mores change often, but the ocean remains largely unchanged.</p>
      <p id=''>Inevitably, long-term cruisers will return to land for short periods, whether to work on repairs, spend time with family or replenish an empty kitty. During that time, spent away from their floating homes, they often write of a natural, physical urge to return to the sea. Often they describe it as all-consuming&mdash;irresistible:</p>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>I felt such a need to rediscover the wind of the high sea, nothing else counted at that moment, neither earth nor men. All Joshua and I wanted was to be left alone with ourselves. Any other thing did not exist, had never existed. You do not ask a tame seagull why it needs to disappear from time to time toward the open sea. It goes, that's all, and it is as simple as a ray of sunshine, as normal as the blue of the sky.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;The Long Way - Bernard Moitessier</div>

</p>
      <p id=''>For Moitessier, that urge is neither good nor bad; it just exists. For other sailors, the lure of the ocean elicits a mixture of positive and negative feelings. Despite the comforts of land, they feel the pull and know it won't be long until they are back in the elements:</p>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>Is it in the nature of all of us, or is it just my own peculiar make-up which brings, when the wind blows, that queer feeling, mingled longing and dread? A thousand invisible fingers seem to be pulling me, trying to draw me away from the four walls where I have every comfort, into the open where I shall have to use my wits and my strength to fool the sea in its treacherous moods, to take advantage of fair winds and to fight when I am fairly caught—for a man is a fool to think he can conquer nature.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>It had been a long time since I had felt the weather-glow on my face, a feeling akin to the numb forehead in the first touch of inebriety.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Alone in the Caribbean - Frederic A. Fencer</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id=''>Fencer touches on another frequently repeated idea: comfort and travel are usually incompatible. But, those that suffer the discomfort are rewarded. A life spent on the move is vivid in ways that are hard to replicate in familiar, stationary life. Grappling with nature and new cultures is exhilarating. So, it's not hard to imagine that land-bound cruisers soon feel the itch to escape:</p>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>We began to notice a strange fact. Our pleasure in the beautiful three-bedroom stone-floored house with its often-used grand piano seemed to diminish as our freedom fund increased. At first we loved having so much room to spread out, and often dined in front of the living room fire when the dining room table was covered with Seraffyn’s freshly varnished hatches, blocks, and bunk boards. But I began to tire of forever leaving the one thing I needed for my downstairs projects in one of the upstairs rooms. I began to resent having to vacuum and dust five rooms when we only used two most of the time. The delight of knowing exactly where to buy each thing I needed in the local shops soon turned to boredom when I never saw a vegetable that was new to me and never found a sausage I hadn’t tried before. The novelty of being able to go to a movie any time we wanted, or listen to live folk music at the local club, or hear a symphony orchestra soon lost their glamor when we always had to drive through the same streets to reach them. It took four and a half months of work before our cruising fund reached the minimum figure we’d set—three thousand dollars. The minute it was fifty dollars over, Larry finished up his last contract and quit working, and we knew it was time to migrate.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Seraffyn's European Adventure - Lin Pardey</div>

      <p id=''>Many people hear the call to adventure. If, when you read about the adventures of Lin and Larry, you lean back in your chair with a sigh and feel the pull of the ocean, then they've just outlined for you the mindset needed to accomplish your dream: let that feeling carry you toward future travels. Don't stay a minute too long.</p>
      <p id=''>Of course, everyone responds to this urge differently. When confronted with these feelings, John Guzwell found it easiest to blame them on the boat:</p>
