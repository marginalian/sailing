      <p id=''>Just about every sailing memoir begins with the dream. The author describes the moment they realized that they could set off on a cruising adventure. They read about those who have done it before, and they research everything they'll need to know once they cast off. And then, as often as not, they describe all the people they meet who have the same dream but who will never reach for it.</p>
      <p id=''><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>But the real problem lay elsewhere: the captain would never put to sea... because he didn’t really want to. Mounier was living SNARK’s voyage in his head, in front of his charts, dreaming of horizons and atolls he would never see.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Tamata and the Alliance - Bernard Moitessier</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id=''>What separates these two groups? Is it mere determination? Many people have written about how to turn a cruising dream into reality, but few have done it as well&mdash;or as consistently&mdash;as Annie Hill, who's been living and traveling on boats since 1975.</p>
      <p id=''>Reading "Voyaging on a Small Income" it's impossible to miss one of Annie Hill's strong suits: she questions everything. She has a knack for both recognizing cognitive dissonance and for rooting it out with straight-forward questions. With typical directness she addresses the excuses often made for not striking out on a sailing adventure:</p>
      <p id=''><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>Quite often, we talk to people about going off cruising and they will say, “If I couldn’t go out for meals or have a drink in a bar, I’d rather not bother, thank you very much.” Your first reaction might be to agree with them, but when you analyse the statement it is quite ludicrous. Are you seriously saying that you would rather carry on working than sacrifice the odd meal out and visits to bars? Are these things so important that you would trade them for the pleasure of living your own life on your own yacht, travelling to different places, doing things in your own time and having the time to appreciate the beauty of the world? If you feel that you can’t do without any of your ‘comforts’, perhaps indeed you prefer the dream to the reality. So many of the things that people regard as necessities are luxuries unheard of 50 years ago. Many of them are in fact, society’s compensations for sending you out to work. When you are in charge of your own life, with the freedom to live as you wish, you don’t need these compensations.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id=''>The trading of comforts for freedom is the backbone of her advice, and she keeps her advice centered squarely on how to take action on the dream rather than dreaming for its own sake.</p>
      <p id=''>She applies this type of thinking to another common question: how much money will I need? It's tempting to answer this question for yourself by deciding what kind of life you want on the water (which conveniences, how much space) and then to work backward to a final number. But often this number is inconceivably large. Hill takes a different approach:</p>
      <p id=''><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>To obtain the necessary wealth to go voyaging, the first thing that you have to do is decide how important it is to you to go voyaging because, quite simply, this will affect how much money you will need — if you want to go voyaging more than anything else, you will be content with very little money while you’re doing it.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id=''>This is good, straightforward advice and it introduces a subtle shade to the point from above: that this dream can be realized through a change in perspective.</p>
      <p id=''><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>Perhaps the most important part of our philosophy is that we choose to voyage on a small income rather than doing it out of necessity. We actually enjoy living on a small amount of money and have no real desire to have any more.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id=''>This was a radical statement when written and more so now. She's saying that she's not <em>making do</em> with less, she is actively pursuing and enjoying less. If you listen carefully, the dream of cruising is often couched in terms that are directly opposite of Hill's: "We'll start out small to learn and then upgrade to the 50-foot catamaran in 5 years." How can you be happy with what you have now when it's sharing space with the next, bigger and shinier part of the dream?</p>
      <p id=''>Does that mean there's something wrong with seeking more comfort while cruising? Of course not. Hill is placing importance on prioritization. If comfort is your priority, the course to achieve the dream is simple: save money until the math works on buying a large catamaran or new monohull. The only shift in perspective you'll need is to accept the amount of time it'll take to get there.</p>
      <p id=''>But Hill challenges us to consider what value to place on independence and freedom:</p>
      <p id=''><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>I believe that one of the great pleasures that we derive from voyaging is that of independence and we have found that the best guarantee of that independence comes from simplicity. Take the yacht herself. If she is a sophisticated boat, with electronics, generators and high tech equipment, your independence will be reduced in relation to the amount of this equipment you can look after by yourself; if you need specialist help then you have to sail to a place where such help is available, which interferes with your freedom of choice. Indeed, essential maintenance in itself controls your actions. The less the necessary maintenance, the freer you are. Financially, you may be a lot better off by playing the money market than by committing yourself to one safe form of investment. However, life will become complicated by the necessity of keeping in touch with what is going on and the need to contact your broker. You’ll probably need some sort of communications system and then what has happened to the peace and tranquillity of a long ocean crossing? In short, the fewer things there are to go wrong, the less there is to worry about and the more time you have for sailing. Moreover, if there’s nothing to go wrong in the first place, then you won’t need to spend anything on putting it right.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id=''>Hill is on an extreme end of the spectrum. But just because you want a water-maker or feel like you need air-conditioning, doesn't mean that there's nothing you can learn from her. The broader takeaway here is that every comfort you take cruising with you will likely lengthen the time before you can leave, shorten the amount of time you can cruise for, or both. From that perspective, it should be easier to decide what your deal breakers are. Everyone's needs are different and Hill says that you might not know what you can't live without until you try it:</p>
      <p id=''><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>When people are deprived of a favourite food, it can start to assume a quite disproportionate importance. We have heard of an American couple who decided to give up cruising because they missed their Cheese Whiz. Only those who have ever sampled this delicacy can realise the true relevance of this story!</div>

      <p id=''><em>Voyaging on a Small Income</em> is well worth a read, as is Hill's ongoing <a target='_blank' href='https://anniehill.blogspot.com/'>blog</a>.</p>
