  </div>
      <p id=''>We've slept on the boat over weekends and holidays, using sleeping bags and trying very hard not to touch the cushions too much. The boat was built in 1976; so were the cushions. Many of them are moldy. At some point during the past 44 years, someone replaced the zipper pulls with cheap metal pieces that have corroded down until they are part of the zipper teeth around them. The tweed is separating on edges and corners. They smell. It's time for them to go.</p>

      <p id=''>So, we have this v-berth. It's too small to sleep in, and the cushions are constantly damp because we store stuff there and none of it gets much airflow to dry out. This would be a prime spot for some real organization, like drop-in cubbies.</p>

  <div class="sans-serif-text">
    &bull;&nbsp;notes&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;
  </div>
      <p id=''>What size boat do I need to cruise full-time? How small is too small? Are larger boats safer in rough seas? These are some of the boat-size questions that face the prospective blue-water cruiser, and there are no easy answers. A quick review of famous cruising vessels doesn't make matters clearer.</p>

      <p id=''>If you ask five sailors how to approach a boat project, you'll likely hear five different solutions. You're also likely to hear from each of them why the other four solutions are idiotic, over-engineered, under-engineered, or just plain wrong.</p>

      <p id=''>Just about every sailing memoir begins with the dream. The author describes the moment they realized that they could set off on a cruising adventure. They read about those who have done it before, and they research everything they'll need to know once they cast off. And then, as often as not, they describe all the people they meet who have the same dream but who will never reach for it.</p>
