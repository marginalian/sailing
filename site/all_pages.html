      <p id=''>What size boat do I need to cruise full-time? How small is too small? Are larger boats safer in rough seas? These are some of the boat-size questions that face the prospective blue-water cruiser, and there are no easy answers. A quick review of famous cruising vessels doesn't make matters clearer.</p>

      <p id=''>If you ask five sailors how to approach a boat project, you'll likely hear five different solutions. You're also likely to hear from each of them why the other four solutions are idiotic, over-engineered, under-engineered, or just plain wrong.</p>

      <p id=''>Just about every sailing memoir begins with the dream. The author describes the moment they realized that they could set off on a cruising adventure. They read about those who have done it before, and they research everything they'll need to know once they cast off. And then, as often as not, they describe all the people they meet who have the same dream but who will never reach for it.</p>
