      <p id=''><em>18 December 2020</em></p>
      <p id=''>Mornings in the apartment were all about routine sameness. There is still routine at the boat, but very little sameness.</p>
      <p id=''>Take for example the morning trip to the restroom. In the apartment, there were ten steps from bed to seat. At the boat, it is a considerably longer trek: down two lengths of dock, up a ramp to the sidewalk, finally past the parking lot. And the walk to the marina facilities is never the same.</p>
      <p id=''>The first morning, I caught the end of a moon set. The moon was as large and orange as I've ever seen it and I had to stop for a minute to appreciate it despite the cold. Next morning, the fog was so dense, I couldn't see the neighboring docks. Later that week, hundreds of crows had gathered in the parking lot for no descernible reason. They cawed and swooped overhead.</p>
      <p id=''>A month ago, I could complete a morning restroom circuit with my eyes closed. Now, I wouldn't want to even if I could.</p>
