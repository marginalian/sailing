      <p id='' ><em>28-29 November 2020</em></p>
      <p id='' >I left our reuseable ice packs on deck last night to let them thaw. By morning, they were still frozen. I guessed that before leaving my bunk. Warm pajamas, a hat, a comforter, a blanket, and a electric blanket were not enough to keep me warm all night. The quarter berth is several degrees cooler than the rest of the boat because there are holes in the aft-most wall to allow the steering cables to connect the throttle with the outboard. Also, I sleep below the waterline which must have something to do with it. Still, it's nice to bundle up, and once I adjust, I'll sleep better with all the blankets.</p>
      <p id='' >Before moving aboard, I worried about the restroom situation: the head onboard is only suitable for liquids. This morning, I faced the object of those worries. I had to make the long trek to the dock restrooms before 6AM. I was rewarded with the sight of a moonset that stopped me in my tracks midway down the dock. The moon was enourmous and more orange than I've ever seen it. What a sight! By the time I returned to the boat it had set completely and I had to content myself with counting the number of birds that were sleeping on docklines.</p>    </article>
