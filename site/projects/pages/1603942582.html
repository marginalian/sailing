      <h1 id='oct&#95;2020&#95;-&#95;v-berth&#95;storage'>Oct 2020 - V-Berth Storage</h1>
      <p id=''>So, we have this v-berth. It's too small to sleep in, and the cushions are constantly damp because we store stuff there and none of it gets much airflow to dry out. This would be a prime spot for some real organization, like drop-in cubbies.</p>
      <p id=''>Some parameters:</p><ul>
      <li id=''>it can't be too heavy, so we have to be careful what materials we use to build the cubbies and what we store there.</li>
      <li id=''>there has got to be air flow on all sides to keep whatever we store there from growing a mold farm.</li>
      <li id=''>the black water tank is below the v-berth and it can smell, especially during the summer time.</li></ul>
      <p id=''>Planned solutions:</p><ul>
      <li id=''>use light woods like cedar and thin boards to keep it light. We'll store clothes and other personal items there which aren't too heavy.</li>
      <li id=''>cedar naturally cuts down on mildew. A boat neighbor built sauna-style, slat floors for his v-berth to keep air flowing under the storage area. We'll use some thin cedar boards for that.</li>
      <li id=''>cedar will also help with the smell.</li></ul>
      <p id=''>To save on time and money, we're using pre-cut cedar closet liner boards laid over a wood frame.</p>
      <h2 id='28&#95;oct&#95;2020'>28 Oct 2020</h2>
      <p id=''>After much planning and gathering of materials, we built the frame today. First step: create a cardboard template of the v-berth:</p>
      <p id=''><div class="img-container">
  <img src="../../../images/projects/vberth_template.jpg">
</div>
</p>
      <p id=''>Next, create a frame in modular sections small enough to carry through the cabin of the boat:</p>
      <p id=''><div class="img-container">
  <img src="../../../images/projects/vberth_frame.jpg">
</div>
</p>
      <h2 id='6&#95;nov&#95;2020'>6 Nov 2020</h2>
      <p id=''>Since the previous update, Sarah finished the flooring of the storage system. It features removable sections so we don't lose access to the deeper storage cutout below:</p>
      <p id=''><div class="img-container">
  <img src="../../../images/projects/vberth_flooring.jpg">
</div>
</p>
      <p id=''>To keep the bottom of the structure from scratching the fiberglass, she added small felt "feet" that are usually meant for chairs on hardwood. Then she added walls to separate the 5 cubbies:</p>
      <p id=''><div class="img-container">
  <img src="../../../images/projects/vberth_cubbies.jpg">
</div>
</p>
      <p id=''>There are only three pieces left:</p><ul>
      <li id=''>the center wall two divide the middle section into 2 cubbies</li>
      <li id=''>storage bins to sit above the aft-most cubbies</li>
      <li id=''>shock cord for the aft-most cubbies to keep everything in place</li></ul>
